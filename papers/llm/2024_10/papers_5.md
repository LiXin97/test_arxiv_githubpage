| **[MeNTi: Bridging Medical Calculator and LLM Agent with Nested Tool Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13610v1)**<details>Integrating tools into Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated the widespread application. Despite this, in specialized downstream task contexts, reliance solely on tools is insufficient to fully address the complexities of the real world. This particularly restricts the effective deployment of LLMs in fields such as medicine. In this paper, we focus on the downstream tasks of medical calculators, which use standardized tests to assess an individual's health status. We introduce MeNTi, a universal agent architecture for LLMs. MeNTi integrates a specialized medical toolkit and employs meta-tool and nested calling mechanisms to enhance LLM tool utilization. Specifically, it achieves flexible tool selection and nested tool calling to address practical issues faced in intricate medical scenarios, including calculator selection, slot filling, and unit conversion. To assess the capabilities of LLMs for quantitative assessment throughout the clinical process of calculator scenarios, we introduce CalcQA. This benchmark requires LLMs to use medical calculators to perform calculations and assess patient health status. CalcQA is constructed by professional physicians and includes 100 case-calculator pairs, complemented by a toolkit of 281 medical tools. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements with our framework. This research paves new directions for applying LLMs in demanding scenarios of medicine.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[LLM-based Unit Test Generation via Property Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13542v1)**<details>Automated unit test generation has been widely studied, with Large Language Models (LLMs) recently showing significant potential. Moreover, in the context of unit test generation, these tools prioritize high code coverage, often at the expense of practical usability, correctness, and maintainability. In response, we propose Property-Based Retrieval Augmentation, a novel mechanism that extends LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) beyond basic vector, text similarity, and graph-based methods. Our approach considers task-specific context and introduces a tailored property retrieval mechanism. Specifically, in the unit test generation task, we account for the unique structure of unit tests by dividing the test generation process into Given, When, and Then phases. When generating tests for a focal method, we not only retrieve general context for the code under test but also consider task-specific context such as pre-existing tests of other methods, which can provide valuable insights for any of the Given, When, and Then phases. This forms property relationships between focal method and other methods, thereby expanding the scope of retrieval beyond traditional RAG. We implement this approach in a tool called APT, which sequentially performs preprocessing, property retrieval, and unit test generation, using an iterative strategy where newly generated tests guide the creation of subsequent ones. We evaluated APT on 12 open-source projects with 1515 methods, and the results demonstrate that APT consistently outperforms existing tools in terms of correctness, completeness, and maintainability of the generated tests. Moreover, we introduce a novel code-context-aware retrieval mechanism for LLMs beyond general context, offering valuable insights and potential applications for other code-related tasks.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[LLM-based Cognitive Models of Students with Misconceptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12294v2)**<details>Accurately modeling student cognition is crucial for developing effective AI-driven educational technologies. A key challenge is creating realistic student models that satisfy two essential properties: (1) accurately replicating specific misconceptions, and (2) correctly solving problems where these misconceptions are not applicable. This dual requirement reflects the complex nature of student understanding, where misconceptions coexist with correct knowledge. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be instruction-tuned to meet this dual requirement and effectively simulate student thinking in algebra. We introduce MalAlgoPy, a novel Python library that generates datasets reflecting authentic student solution patterns through a graph-based representation of algebraic problem-solving. Utilizing MalAlgoPy, we define and examine Cognitive Student Models (CSMs) - LLMs instruction tuned to faithfully emulate realistic student behavior. Our findings reveal that LLMs trained on misconception examples can efficiently learn to replicate errors. However, the training diminishes the model's ability to solve problems correctly, particularly for problem types where the misconceptions are not applicable, thus failing to satisfy second property of CSMs. We demonstrate that by carefully calibrating the ratio of correct to misconception examples in the training data - sometimes as low as 0.25 - it is possible to develop CSMs that satisfy both properties. Our insights enhance our understanding of AI-based student models and pave the way for effective adaptive learning systems.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[Learning to Ask Informative Questions: Enhancing LLMs with Preference Optimization and Expected Information Gain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17453v3)**<details>Questions are essential tools for acquiring the necessary information to complete information-seeking tasks. However, large language models (LLMs), especially open-source models, often perform poorly in generating informative questions, as measured by expected information gain (EIG). In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the informativeness of LLM-generated questions in 20-question game dialogues. We sample multiple questions from the same model (LLAMA 2-CHAT 7B) for each game and create pairs of low-EIG and high-EIG questions to apply a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. Our results show that this method produces more effective questions (in terms of EIG), even in domains different from those used to train the DPO model.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 (Findings)</details> |
| **[Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13461v1)**<details>In spite of the great potential of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to their excessive computational and memory demands. Quantization has emerged as an effective solution by storing weights in reduced precision. However, utilizing low precisions (i.e.~2/3-bit) to substantially alleviate the memory-boundedness of LLM decoding, still suffers from prohibitive performance drop. In this work, we argue that existing approaches fail to explore the diversity in computational patterns, redundancy, and sensitivity to approximations of the different phases of LLM inference, resorting to a uniform quantization policy throughout. Instead, we propose a novel phase-aware method that selectively allocates precision during different phases of LLM inference, achieving both strong context extraction during prefill and efficient memory bandwidth utilization during decoding. To further address the memory-boundedness of the decoding phase, we introduce Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding (PMPD), a technique that enables the gradual lowering of precision deeper in the generated sequence, together with a spectrum of precision-switching schedulers that dynamically drive the precision-lowering decisions in either task-adaptive or prompt-adaptive manner. Extensive evaluation across diverse language tasks shows that when targeting Nvidia GPUs, PMPD achieves 1.4$-$12.2$\times$ speedup in matrix-vector multiplications over fp16 models, while when targeting an LLM-optimized NPU, our approach delivers a throughput gain of 3.8$-$8.0$\times$ over fp16 models and up to 1.54$\times$ over uniform quantization approaches while preserving the output quality.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[Aegis:An Advanced LLM-Based Multi-Agent for Intelligent Functional Safety Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12475v2)**<details>Functional safety is a critical aspect of automotive engineering, encompassing all phases of a vehicle's lifecycle, including design, development, production, operation, and decommissioning. This domain involves highly knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces Aegis: An Advanced LLM-Based Multi-Agent for Intelligent Functional Safety Engineering. Aegis is specifically designed to support complex functional safety tasks within the automotive sector. It is tailored to perform Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment(HARA), document Functional Safety Requirements(FSR), and plan test cases for Automatic Emergency Braking(AEB) systems. The most advanced version, Aegis-Max, leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and reflective mechanisms to enhance its capability in managing complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. Additionally, targeted prompt refinement by professional functional safety practitioners can significantly optimize Aegis's performance in the functional safety domain. This paper demonstrates the potential of Aegis to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of functional safety processes in automotive engineering.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation for Assessing Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13394v1)**<details>Evaluating machine-generated text remains a significant challenge in NLP, especially for non-English languages. Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers in English. Our experiments demonstrate that Hercule aligns more closely with human judgments compared to proprietary models, demonstrating the effectiveness of such cross-lingual evaluation in low resource scenarios. Further, it is also effective in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. This study is the first comprehensive examination of cross-lingual evaluation using LLMs, presenting a scalable and effective approach for multilingual assessment. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly available to enable further research in this important area.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |

We deployed a customized SSH honeypot and applied prompt injections with temporal analysis to identify LLM-based agents among attackers. Over a trial run of a few weeks in a public environment, we collected 800,000 hacking attempts and 6 potential AI agents, which we plan to analyze in depth in future work. Our objectives aim to improve awareness of AI hacking agents and enhance preparedness for their risks.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[MedAide: Towards an Omni Medical Aide via Specialized LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12532v2)**<details>Large Language Model (LLM)-driven interactive systems currently show potential promise in healthcare domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs typically lack personalized recommendations and diagnosis analysis in sophisticated medical applications, causing hallucinations and performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MedAide, an LLM-based omni medical multi-agent collaboration framework for specialized healthcare services. Specifically, MedAide first performs query rewriting through retrieval-augmented generation to accomplish accurate medical intent understanding. Immediately, we devise a contextual encoder to obtain intent prototype embeddings, which are used to recognize fine-grained intents by similarity matching. According to the intent relevance, the activated agents collaborate effectively to provide integrated decision analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on four medical benchmarks with composite intents. Experimental results from automated metrics and expert doctor evaluations show that MedAide outperforms current LLMs and improves their medical proficiency and strategic reasoning.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration for Medical Applications</details> |
| **[Enhancing LLM Trading Performance with Fact-Subjectivity Aware Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12464v2)**<details>While many studies prove more advanced LLMs perform better on tasks such as math and coding, we notice that in cryptocurrency trading, stronger LLMs work worse than weaker LLMs often. To study how this counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs, we examine the LLM reasoning processes on making trading decisions. We find that separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components can lead to higher profits. Building on this insight, we introduce a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that relying on subjective news tends to generate higher returns in bull markets, whereas focusing on factual information yields better results in bear markets.

| **[Combating Phone Scams with LLM-based Detection: Where Do We Stand?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11643v2)**<details>Phone scams pose a significant threat to individuals and communities, causing substantial financial losses and emotional distress. Despite ongoing efforts to combat these scams, scammers continue to adapt and refine their tactics, making it imperative to explore innovative countermeasures. This research explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide detection of fraudulent phone calls. By analyzing the conversational dynamics between scammers and victims, LLM-based detectors can identify potential scams as they occur, offering immediate protection to users. While such approaches demonstrate promising results, we also acknowledge the challenges of biased datasets, relatively low recall, and hallucinations that must be addressed for further advancement in this field</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>2 pages, 1 figure</details> |
| **[Do LLMs Overcome Shortcut Learning? An Evaluation of Shortcut Challenges in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13343v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs may rely on dataset biases as shortcuts for prediction, which can significantly impair their robustness and generalization capabilities. This paper presents Shortcut Suite, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the impact of shortcuts on LLMs' performance, incorporating six shortcut types, five evaluation metrics, and four prompting strategies. Our extensive experiments yield several key findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate varying reliance on shortcuts for downstream tasks, significantly impairing their performance. 2) Larger LLMs are more likely to utilize shortcuts under zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning prompts. 3) Chain-of-thought prompting notably reduces shortcut reliance and outperforms other prompting strategies, while few-shot prompts generally underperform compared to zero-shot prompts. 4) LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, especially when dealing with datasets that contain shortcuts. 5) LLMs generally have a lower explanation quality in shortcut-laden datasets, with errors falling into three types: distraction, disguised comprehension, and logical fallacy. Our findings offer new insights for evaluating robustness and generalization in LLMs and suggest potential directions for mitigating the reliance on shortcuts.

| **[Limits to scalable evaluation at the frontier: LLM as Judge won't beat twice the data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13341v1)**<details>High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>22 pages, 5 figures</details> |
| **[Comparing the Utility, Preference, and Performance of Course Material Search Functionality and Retrieval-Augmented Generation Large Language Model (RAG-LLM) AI Chatbots in Information-Seeking Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13326v1)**<details>Providing sufficient support for students requires substantial resources, especially considering the growing enrollment numbers. Students need help in a variety of tasks, ranging from information-seeking to requiring support with course assignments. To explore the utility of recent large language models (LLMs) as a support mechanism, we developed an LLM-powered AI chatbot that augments the answers that are produced with information from the course materials. To study the effect of the LLM-powered AI chatbot, we conducted a lab-based user study (N=14), in which the participants worked on tasks from a web software development course. The participants were divided into two groups, where one of the groups first had access to the chatbot and then to a more traditional search functionality, while another group started with the search functionality and was then given the chatbot. We assessed the participants' performance and perceptions towards the chatbot and the search functionality and explored their preferences towards the support functionalities. Our findings highlight that both support mechanisms are seen as useful and that support mechanisms work well for specific tasks, while less so for other tasks. We also observe that students tended to prefer the second support mechanism more, where students who were first given the chatbot tended to prefer the search functionality and vice versa.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>12 pages, 4 figures</details> |
| **[Leveraging LLM Embeddings for Cross Dataset Label Alignment and Zero Shot Music Emotion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11522v2)**<details>In this work, we present a novel method for music emotion recognition that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings for label alignment across multiple datasets and zero-shot prediction on novel categories. First, we compute LLM embeddings for emotion labels and apply non-parametric clustering to group similar labels, across multiple datasets containing disjoint labels. We use these cluster centers to map music features (MERT) to the LLM embedding space. To further enhance the model, we introduce an alignment regularization that enables dissociation of MERT embeddings from different clusters. This further enhances the model's ability to better adaptation to unseen datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing zero-shot inference on a new dataset, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen labels without additional training.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[Perceive, Reflect, and Plan: Designing LLM Agent for Goal-Directed City Navigation without Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04168v3)**<details>This paper considers a scenario in city navigation: an AI agent is provided with language descriptions of the goal location with respect to some well-known landmarks; By only observing the scene around, including recognizing landmarks and road network connections, the agent has to make decisions to navigate to the goal location without instructions. This problem is very challenging, because it requires agent to establish self-position and acquire spatial representation of complex urban environment, where landmarks are often invisible. In the absence of navigation instructions, such abilities are vital for the agent to make high-quality decisions in long-range city navigation. With the emergent reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), a tempting baseline is to prompt LLMs to "react" on each observation and make decisions accordingly. However, this baseline has very poor performance that the agent often repeatedly visits same locations and make short-sighted, inconsistent decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel agentic workflow featured by its abilities to perceive, reflect and plan. Specifically, we find LLaVA-7B can be fine-tuned to perceive the direction and distance of landmarks with sufficient accuracy for city navigation. Moreover, reflection is achieved through a memory mechanism, where past experiences are stored and can be retrieved with current perception for effective decision argumentation. Planning uses reflection results to produce long-term plans, which can avoid short-sighted decisions in long-range navigation. We show the designed workflow significantly improves navigation ability of the LLM agent compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[DAQ: Density-Aware Post-Training Weight-Only Quantization For LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12187v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but face deployment challenges due to hardware constraints. We propose density-aware post-training weight-only quantization (DAQ), which has two stages: 1) density-centric alignment, which identifies the center of high-density weights and centers the dynamic range on this point to align high-density weight regions with floating-point high-precision regions; 2) learnable dynamic range adjustment, which adjusts the dynamic range by optimizing quantization parameters (i.e., scale and zero-point) based on the impact of weights on the model output. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 show that DAQ consistently outperforms the best baseline method, reducing perplexity loss by an average of 22.8% on LLaMA and 19.6% on LLaMA-2. Our code is available at https://github.com/LuoYingSong/DAQ.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>9 pages, 4 figures</details> |
| **[Atomic Calibration of LLMs in Long-Form Generations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13246v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, posing significant challenges for real-world applications. Confidence calibration, which estimates the underlying uncertainty of model predictions, is essential to enhance the LLMs' trustworthiness. Existing research on LLM calibration has primarily focused on short-form tasks, providing a single confidence score at the response level (macro calibration). However, this approach is insufficient for long-form generations, where responses often contain more complex statements and may include both accurate and inaccurate information. Therefore, we introduce atomic calibration, a novel approach that evaluates factuality calibration at a fine-grained level by breaking down long responses into atomic claims. We classify confidence elicitation methods into discriminative and generative types and demonstrate that their combination can enhance calibration. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs and datasets show that atomic calibration is well-suited for long-form generation and can also improve macro calibration results. Additionally, atomic calibration reveals insightful patterns in LLM confidence throughout the generation process.</details> | 2024-10-17 |  |
| **[MedCare: Advancing Medical LLMs through Decoupling Clinical Alignment and Knowledge Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17484v3)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have shown substantial progress in natural language understanding and generation, proving valuable especially in the medical field. Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks, which can be categorized as knowledge-intensive tasks and alignment-required tasks. Previous approaches either ignore the latter task or focus on a minority of tasks and hence lose generalization. To address these drawbacks, we propose a progressive fine-tuning pipeline. This pipeline employs a Knowledge Aggregator and a Noise aggregator to encode diverse knowledge in the first stage and filter out detrimental information. In the second stage, we drop the Noise Aggregator to avoid the interference of suboptimal representation and leverage an additional alignment module optimized towards an orthogonal direction to the knowledge space to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Based on this two-stage paradigm, we proposed a Medical LLM through decoupling Clinical Alignment and Knowledge Aggregation (MedCare), which is designed to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, as well as SOTA results on specific medical alignment tasks. Various model sizes of MedCare (1.8B, 7B, 14B) all demonstrate significant improvements over existing models with similar model sizes.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>EMNLP2024 Findings</details> |
| **[FaithBench: A Diverse Hallucination Benchmark for Summarization by Modern LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13210v1)**<details>Summarization is one of the most common tasks performed by large language models (LLMs), especially in applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing evaluations of hallucinations in LLM-generated summaries, and evaluations of hallucination detection models both suffer from a lack of diversity and recency in the LLM and LLM families considered. This paper introduces FaithBench, a summarization hallucination benchmark comprising challenging hallucinations made by 10 modern LLMs from 8 different families, with ground truth annotations by human experts. ``Challenging'' here means summaries on which popular, state-of-the-art hallucination detection models, including GPT-4o-as-a-judge, disagreed on. Our results show GPT-4o and GPT-3.5-Turbo produce the least hallucinations. However, even the best hallucination detection models have near 50\% accuracies on FaithBench, indicating lots of room for future improvement.

| **[Mixture of In-Context Experts Enhance LLMs' Long Context Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19598v2)**<details>Many studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) exhibit uneven awareness of different contextual positions. Their limited context awareness can lead to overlooking critical information and subsequent task failures. While several approaches have been proposed to enhance LLMs' context awareness, achieving both effectiveness and efficiency remains challenging. In this paper, for LLMs utilizing RoPE as position embeddings, we introduce a novel method called "Mixture of In-Context Experts" (MoICE) to address this challenge. MoICE comprises two key components: a router integrated into each attention head within LLMs and a lightweight router-only training optimization strategy: (1) MoICE views each RoPE angle as an `in-context' expert, demonstrated to be capable of directing the attention of a head to specific contextual positions. Consequently, each attention head flexibly processes tokens using multiple RoPE angles dynamically selected by the router to attend to the needed positions. This approach mitigates the risk of overlooking essential contextual information. (2) The router-only training strategy entails freezing LLM parameters and exclusively updating routers for only a few steps. When applied to open-source LLMs including Llama and Mistral, MoICE surpasses prior methods across multiple tasks on long context understanding and generation, all while maintaining commendable inference efficiency.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>Accepted by Neurips2024</details> |

Our analyses extend across six benchmarks for table-related tasks such as question-answering and fact-checking. We introduce for the first time the assessment of LLMs' performance on image-based table representations. Specifically, we compare five text-based and three image-based table representations, demonstrating the role of representation and prompting on LLM performance. Our study provides insights into the effective use of LLMs on table-related tasks.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings; Naihao and Zhenjie contributed equally to the project; Data available at: https://github.com/dnaihao/Tables-as-Texts-or-Images</details> |

However, these models can be expensive to query in real-time and do not allow for a community-specific approach to content moderation. To address these challenges, we explore the use of open-source small language models (SLMs) for community-specific content moderation tasks. We fine-tune and evaluate SLMs (less than 15B parameters) by comparing their performance against much larger open- and closed-sourced models. Using 150K comments from 15 popular Reddit communities, we find that SLMs outperform LLMs at content moderation -- 11.5% higher accuracy and 25.7% higher recall on average across all communities. We further show the promise of cross-community content moderation, which has implications for new communities and the development of cross-platform moderation techniques. Finally, we outline directions for future work on language model based content moderation. Code and links to HuggingFace models can be found at https://github.com/AGoyal0512/SLM-Mod.</details> | 2024-10-17 | <details>Preprint: 15 pages, 8 figures, 8 pages</details> |
| **[Self-Reflection in LLM Agents: Effects on Problem-Solving Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06682v3)**<details>In this study, we investigated the effects of self-reflection in large language models (LLMs) on problem-solving performance. We instructed nine popular LLMs to answer a series of multiple-choice questions to provide a performance baseline. For each incorrectly answered question, we instructed eight types of self-reflecting LLM agents to reflect on their mistakes and provide themselves with guidance to improve problem-solving. Then, using this guidance, each self-reflecting agent attempted to re-answer the same questions. Our results indicate that LLM agents are able to significantly improve their problem-solving performance through self-reflection ($p < 0.001$). In addition, we compared the various types of self-reflection to determine their individual contribution to performance.

| **[Hypothesis Testing the Circuit Hypothesis in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13032v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate surprising capabilities, but we do not understand how they are implemented. One hypothesis suggests that these capabilities are primarily executed by small subnetworks within the LLM, known as circuits. But how can we evaluate this hypothesis? In this paper, we formalize a set of criteria that a circuit is hypothesized to meet and develop a suite of hypothesis tests to evaluate how well circuits satisfy them. The criteria focus on the extent to which the LLM's behavior is preserved, the degree of localization of this behavior, and whether the circuit is minimal. We apply these tests to six circuits described in the research literature. We find that synthetic circuits -- circuits that are hard-coded in the model -- align with the idealized properties. Circuits discovered in Transformer models satisfy the criteria to varying degrees. To facilitate future empirical studies of circuits, we created the \textit{circuitry} package, a wrapper around the \textit{TransformerLens} library, which abstracts away lower-level manipulations of hooks and activations. The software is available at \url{https://github.com/blei-lab/circuitry}.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Code available here: https://github.com/blei-lab/circuitry</details> |

However, the challenge of effectively synthesizing insights from diverse data sources and integrating both structured and unstructured data persists. This paper presents TradeExpert, a novel framework that employs a mix of experts (MoE) approach, using four specialized LLMs, each analyzing distinct sources of financial data, including news articles, market data, alpha factors, and fundamental data. The insights of these expert LLMs are further synthesized by a General Expert LLM to make a final prediction or decision. With specific prompts, TradeExpert can be switched between the prediction mode and the ranking mode for stock movement prediction and quantitative stock trading, respectively. In addition to existing benchmarks, we also release a large-scale financial dataset to comprehensively evaluate TradeExpert's effectiveness.

| **[Codellm-Devkit: A Framework for Contextualizing Code LLMs with Program Analysis Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13007v1)**<details>Large Language Models for Code (or code LLMs) are increasingly gaining popularity and capabilities, offering a wide array of functionalities such as code completion, code generation, code summarization, test generation, code translation, and more. To leverage code LLMs to their full potential, developers must provide code-specific contextual information to the models. These are typically derived and distilled using program analysis tools. However, there exists a significant gap--these static analysis tools are often language-specific and come with a steep learning curve, making their effective use challenging. These tools are tailored to specific program languages, requiring developers to learn and manage multiple tools to cover various aspects of the their code base. Moreover, the complexity of configuring and integrating these tools into the existing development environments add an additional layer of difficulty. This challenge limits the potential benefits that could be gained from more widespread and effective use of static analysis in conjunction with LLMs. To address this challenge, we present codellm-devkit (hereafter, `CLDK'), an open-source library that significantly simplifies the process of performing program analysis at various levels of granularity for different programming languages to support code LLM use cases. As a Python library, CLDK offers developers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it incredibly easy to provide rich program analysis context to code LLMs. With this library, developers can effortlessly integrate detailed, code-specific insights that enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in coding tasks. CLDK is available as an open-source library at https://github.com/IBM/codellm-devkit.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Translating and Classifying Mental Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12985v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in medical fields. In mental health support, the early identification of linguistic markers associated with mental health conditions can provide valuable support to mental health professionals, and reduce long waiting times for patients. Despite the benefits of LLMs for mental health support, there is limited research on their application in mental health systems for languages other than English. Our study addresses this gap by focusing on the detection of depression severity in Greek through user-generated posts which are automatically translated from English. Our results show that GPT3.5-turbo is not very successful in identifying the severity of depression in English, and it has a varying performance in Greek as well. Our study underscores the necessity for further research, especially in languages with less resources. Also, careful implementation is necessary to ensure that LLMs are used effectively in mental health platforms, and human supervision remains crucial to avoid misdiagnosis.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a query-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over long-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the input video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection of keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is often overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate multigranularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing VideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide range of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree aggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree structure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our experiments show that our training-free method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms the existing training-free approaches on the popular EgoSchema and NExT-QA benchmarks with less inference time, achieving 61.1% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training. Moreover, on the long split of Video-MME benchmark (average 44 minutes), the training-free VideoTree framework achieves better performance than the strong proprietary GPT-4V model and other MLLMs that were extensively trained on video data.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>23 pages, first three authors contributed equally; Project page: https://videotree2024.github.io/</details> |
| **[Facilitating Multi-turn Function Calling for LLMs via Compositional Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12952v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant potential in performing diverse tasks, including the ability to call functions or use external tools to enhance their performance. While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding functions are then developed for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs by Stepwise Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12934v1)**<details>Best-of-N decoding methods instruct large language models (LLMs) to generate multiple solutions, score each using a scoring function, and select the highest scored as the final answer to mathematical reasoning problems. However, this repeated independent process often leads to the same mistakes, making the selected solution still incorrect. We propose a novel prompting method named Stepwise Correction (StepCo) that helps LLMs identify and revise incorrect steps in their generated reasoning paths. It iterates verification and revision phases that employ a process-supervised verifier. The verify-then-revise process not only improves answer correctness but also reduces token consumption with fewer paths needed to generate. With StepCo, a series of LLMs demonstrate exceptional performance. Notably, using GPT-4o as the backend LLM, StepCo achieves an average accuracy of 94.1 across eight datasets, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art Best-of-N method by +2.4, while reducing token consumption by 77.8%.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>under review</details> |
| **[Interpreting token compositionality in LLMs: A robustness analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12924v1)**<details>Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) is integral to enhancing their reliability, interpretability, and inference processes. We present Constituent-Aware Pooling (CAP), a methodology designed to analyse how LLMs process compositional linguistic structures. Grounded in principles of compositionality, mechanistic interpretability, and information gain theory, CAP systematically intervenes in model activations through constituent-based pooling at various model levels. Our experiments on inverse definition modelling, hypernym and synonym prediction reveal critical insights into transformers' limitations in handling compositional abstractions. No specific layer integrates tokens into unified semantic representations based on their constituent parts. We observe fragmented information processing, which intensifies with model size, suggesting that larger models struggle more with these interventions and exhibit greater information dispersion. This fragmentation likely stems from transformers' training objectives and architectural design, preventing systematic and cohesive representations. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in current transformer architectures regarding compositional semantics processing and model interpretability, underscoring the critical need for novel approaches in LLM design to address these challenges.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>15 pages, 2 Figures, 7 tables</details> |
| **[JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12784v1)**<details>LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges.

| **[In-Context Learning Enables Robot Action Prediction in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12782v1)**<details>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success using in-context learning (ICL) in the language domain. However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[SplitLLM: Collaborative Inference of LLMs for Model Placement and Throughput Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10759v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have been a disruptive innovation in recent years, and they play a crucial role in our daily lives due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Their capabilities include natural language understanding, information retrieval and search, translation, chatbots, virtual assistance, and many more. However, it is well known that LLMs are massive in terms of the number of parameters. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in the underlying architecture of LLMs, Transformers, has quadratic complexity in terms of both computation and memory with respect to the input sequence length. For these reasons, LLM inference is resource-intensive, and thus, the throughput of LLM inference is limited, especially for the longer sequences. In this report, we design a collaborative inference architecture between a server and its clients to alleviate the throughput limit. In this design, we consider the available resources on both sides, i.e., the computation and communication costs. We develop a dynamic programming-based algorithm to optimally allocate computation between the server and the client device to increase the server throughput, while not violating the service level agreement (SLA). We show in the experiments that we are able to efficiently distribute the workload allowing for roughly 1/3 reduction in the server workload, while achieving 19 percent improvement over a greedy method. As a result, we are able to demonstrate that, in an environment with different types of LLM inference requests, the throughput of the server is improved.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[FusionLLM: A Decentralized LLM Training System on Geo-distributed GPUs with Adaptive Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12707v1)**<details>To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions. To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Unsupervised End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue with LLMs: The Power of the Noisy Channel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15219v2)**<details>Training task-oriented dialogue systems typically requires turn-level annotations for interacting with their APIs: e.g. a dialogue state and the system actions taken at each step. These annotations can be costly to produce, error-prone, and require both domain and annotation expertise. With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that unlabeled data and a schema definition are sufficient for building a working task-oriented dialogue system, completely unsupervised. We consider a novel unsupervised setting of only (1) a well-defined API schema (2) a set of unlabeled dialogues between a user and agent. We propose an innovative approach using expectation-maximization (EM) that infers turn-level annotations as latent variables using a noisy channel model to build an end-to-end dialogue agent. Evaluating our approach on the MultiWOZ benchmark, our method more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong GPT-3.5 baseline.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>To be presented at Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2024). 18 Pages, 8 Figures</details> |

This study proposes ToBlend, a novel token-level ensemble text generation method to challenge the robustness of current AI-content detection approaches by utilizing multiple sets of candidate generative large language models (LLMs). By randomly sampling token(s) from candidate LLMs sets, we find ToBlend significantly drops the performance of most mainstream AI-content detection methods. We evaluate the text quality produced under different ToBlend settings based on annotations from experienced human experts. We proposed a fine-tuned Llama3.1 model to distinguish the ToBlend generated text more accurately. Our findings underscore our proposed text generation approach's great potential in deceiving and improving detection models.

| **[Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15360v3)**<details>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07140v4)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, a benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., empirical focus), which are more subjective and conceptual. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4, LLaMA2, and other popular LLMs under various settings. Our findings reveal significant limitations in large language models' ability to balance trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores how to manipulate evidence, simulating potential misuse scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate its negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from both the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets present that evidence pollution, especially the generate strategy, significantly compromises existing detectors. On the other hand, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment, such as the need for annotated data and huge inference costs. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence is of high quality, would compromise the model calibration, and could ensemble to amplify the negative impact.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

In this paper, we introduce a new LLM decision-making framework called STRUX, which enhances LLM decision-making by providing structured explanations. These include favorable and adverse facts related to the decision, along with their respective strengths. STRUX begins by distilling lengthy information into a concise table of key facts. It then employs a series of self-reflection steps to determine which of these facts are pivotal, categorizing them as either favorable or adverse in relation to a specific decision. Lastly, we fine-tune an LLM to identify and prioritize these key facts to optimize decision-making. STRUX has been evaluated on the challenging task of forecasting stock investment decisions based on earnings call transcripts and demonstrated superior performance against strong baselines. It enhances decision transparency by allowing users to understand the impact of different factors, representing a meaningful step towards practical decision-making with LLMs.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to NAACL 2025</details> |

However, LLM evaluators often display biased preferences, such as favoring verbosity and authoritative tones. Our empirical analysis reveals that these biases are exacerbated in pairwise evaluation, where LLMs directly compare two outputs and easily prioritize superficial attributes. In contrast, pointwise evaluation, which assesses outputs independently, is less susceptible to such bias because each output is judged in isolation. To address the limitations of the pairwise evaluation, we introduce a novel evaluation method, PRePair, which integrates pointwise reasoning within a pairwise framework. PRePair effectively alleviates biased preference, improving performance on the adversarial benchmark (LLMBar) while outperforming pointwise evaluation on the standard benchmark (MT-Bench).</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

While these tools can help people by generating ideas or producing higher quality work, like many other AI tools they may risk causing a variety of harms, disproportionately burdening historically marginalized groups. In this work, we introduce and evaluate perceptual harm, a term for the harm caused to users when others perceive or suspect them of using AI. We examined perceptual harms in three online experiments, each of which entailed human participants evaluating the profiles for fictional freelance writers. We asked participants whether they suspected the freelancers of using AI, the quality of their writing, and whether they should be hired. We found some support for perceptual harms against for certain demographic groups, but that perceptions of AI use negatively impacted writing evaluations and hiring outcomes across the board.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

However, both the pre-training and SFT stages fail to explicitly model the comparative relationships of a user's preferences on different items. To construct a "helpful and harmless" LLM-based recommender, we propose a general framework -- Recommendation with smoothing personalized Preference Optimization (RosePO), which better aligns with customized human values during the post-training stage. Specifically, in addition to the input and chosen response that naturally align with SFT data, we design a rejected sampling strategy tailored for enhancing helpfulness, along with two strategies aimed at mitigating biases to promote harmlessness. To ensure robustness against uncertain labels present in automatically constructed preference data, we introduce a personalized smoothing factor predicted by a preference oracle into the optimization objective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showcasing not only improved recommendation performance but also mitigation of semantic hallucination and popularity bias.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

We introduce a methodology for generating a bias detection dataset using seven bias triggers: General Debate, Positioned Debate, Career Advice, Story Generation, Problem-Solving, Cover-Letter Writing, and CV Generation. We use GPT-4o to generate a diverse set of prompts for each trigger across various genders, religious and racial groups. We evaluate models from Llama and Gemma family on the generated dataset. We anonymise the LLM-generated text associated with each group using GPT-4o-mini and do a pairwise comparison using GPT-4o-as-a-Judge. To quantify bias in the LLM-generated text we use the number of wins and losses in the pairwise comparison. Our analysis spans three languages, English, German, and Arabic to explore how language influences bias manifestation. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit strong polarization toward certain groups across each category, with a notable consistency observed across models. However, when switching languages, variations and anomalies emerge, often attributable to cultural cues and contextual differences.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response generation module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 80.40% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Preprint</details> |

When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in these tasks, they suffer from hallucinations and confusion about task instructions. In this paper, we present the Knowledge-Compliant Matching Framework (KcMF), an LLM-based approach that addresses these issues without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. KcMF employs a pseudo-code-based task decomposition strategy to adopt task-specific natural language statements that guide LLM reasoning and reduce confusion. We also propose two mechanisms, Dataset as Knowledge (DaK) and Example as Knowledge (EaK), to build domain knowledge sets when unstructured domain knowledge is lacking. Additionally, we introduce a result-ensembling strategy to leverage multiple knowledge sources and suppress poorly formatted outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on schema and entity matching tasks demonstrate that KcMF outperforms previous non-LLM state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average F1 score of 22.9% and competes effectively with SOTA fine-tuned LLMs. Moreover, KcMF generalizes well across different LLMs.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

However, crowd-sourcing is often expensive and can lack quality, especially for non-trivial tasks. We propose a method of using LLMs as few-shot learners for annotating data in a complex natural language task where we learn a standalone model to predict usage options for products from customer reviews. We also propose a new evaluation metric for this scenario, HAMS4, that can be used to compare a set of strings with multiple reference sets. Learning a custom model offers individual control over energy efficiency and privacy measures compared to using the LLM directly for the sequence-to-sequence task. We compare this data annotation approach with other traditional methods and demonstrate how LLMs can enable considerable cost savings. We find that the quality of the resulting data exceeds the level attained by third-party vendor services and that GPT-4-generated labels even reach the level of domain experts. We make the code and generated labels publicly available.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>9 pages</details> |

Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible "strategy-criterion" format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights. These concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent, which implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical domain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

While training-based video-LLMs deliver high performance, they often require substantial resources for training and inference. Conversely, training-free approaches offer a more efficient alternative by adapting pre-trained image-LLMs models for video tasks without additional training, but they face inference efficiency bottlenecks due to the large number of visual tokens generated from video frames. In this work, we present a novel prompt-guided visual perception framework (abbreviated as Free Video-LLM) for efficient inference of training-free video LLMs. The proposed framework decouples spatial-temporal dimension and performs temporal frame sampling and spatial RoI cropping respectively based on task-specific prompts. Our method effectively reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining high performance across multiple video question-answering benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results with significantly fewer tokens, offering an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/contrastive/FreeVideoLLM.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Tech report</details> |
| **[ProSA: Assessing and Understanding the Prompt Sensitivity of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12405v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance is highly sensitive to the prompts utilized. This variability poses challenges for accurate assessment and user satisfaction. Current research frequently overlooks instance-level prompt variations and their implications on subjective evaluations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ProSA, a framework designed to evaluate and comprehend prompt sensitivity in LLMs. ProSA incorporates a novel sensitivity metric, PromptSensiScore, and leverages decoding confidence to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our extensive study, spanning multiple tasks, uncovers that prompt sensitivity fluctuates across datasets and models, with larger models exhibiting enhanced robustness. We observe that few-shot examples can alleviate this sensitivity issue, and subjective evaluations are also susceptible to prompt sensitivities, particularly in complex, reasoning-oriented tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that higher model confidence correlates with increased prompt robustness. We believe this work will serve as a helpful tool in studying prompt sensitivity of LLMs. The project is released at: https://github.com/open-compass/ProSA .</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>EMNLP 2024, Findings</details> |

Their superior language understanding and reasoning capabilities allow users to automate complex and repetitive tasks. However, due to the inherent unreliability and high operational cost of LLMs, their practical applicability is quite limited. To address these issues, this paper introduces MobileGPT, an innovative LLM-based mobile task automator equipped with a human-like app memory. MobileGPT emulates the cognitive process of humans interacting with a mobile app -- explore, select, derive, and recall. This approach allows for a more precise and efficient learning of a task's procedure by breaking it down into smaller, modular sub-tasks that can be re-used, re-arranged, and adapted for various objectives. We implement MobileGPT using online LLMs services (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and evaluate its performance on a dataset of 185 tasks across 18 mobile apps. The results indicate that MobileGPT can automate and learn new tasks with 82.7% accuracy, and is able to adapt them to different contexts with near perfect (98.75%) accuracy while reducing both latency and cost by 62.5% and 68.8%, respectively, compared to the GPT-4 powered baseline.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

Additionally, deploying LLMs on edge devices is trending for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, edge deployment of proprietary LLMs introduces new security threats: attackers who obtain an edge-deployed LLM can easily use it as a base model for various tasks due to its high generalization ability, which we call foundational capability stealing. Unfortunately, existing model protection mechanisms are often task-specific and fail to protect general-purpose LLMs, as they mainly focus on protecting task-related parameters using trusted execution environments (TEEs). Although some recent TEE-based methods are able to protect the overall model parameters in a computation-efficient way, they still suffer from prohibitive communication costs between TEE and CPU/GPU, making it impractical to deploy for edge LLMs. To protect the foundational capabilities of edge LLMs, we propose CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient model protection approach against model stealing on edge devices. The core component of CoreGuard is a lightweight and propagative authorization module residing in TEE. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves the same security protection as the black-box security guarantees with negligible overhead.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[I Want to Break Free! Persuasion and Anti-Social Behavior of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109v2)**<details>As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Understanding the Role of LLMs in Multimodal Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12329v1)**<details>The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been accompanied by the development of various benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, the true nature of these evaluations and the extent to which they assess multimodal reasoning versus merely leveraging the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) backbone remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of LLM backbones in MLLM evaluation, focusing on two critical aspects: the degree to which current benchmarks truly assess multimodal reasoning and the influence of LLM prior knowledge on performance. Specifically, we introduce a modified evaluation protocol to disentangle the contributions of the LLM backbone from multimodal integration, and an automatic knowledge identification technique for diagnosing whether LLMs equip the necessary knowledge for corresponding multimodal questions. Our study encompasses four diverse MLLM benchmarks and eight state-of-the-art MLLMs. Key findings reveal that some benchmarks allow high performance even without visual inputs and up to 50\% of error rates can be attributed to insufficient world knowledge in the LLM backbone, indicating a heavy reliance on language capabilities. To address knowledge deficiencies, we propose a knowledge augmentation pipeline that achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to 60\% on certain datasets, resulting in a approximately 4x increase in performance. Our work provides crucial insights into the role of the LLM backbone in MLLMs, and highlights the need for more nuanced benchmarking approaches.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

Traditional fingerprinting methods often require significant computational overhead or white-box verification access. In this paper, we introduce UTF, a novel and efficient approach to fingerprinting LLMs by leveraging under-trained tokens. Under-trained tokens are tokens that the model has not fully learned during its training phase. By utilizing these tokens, we perform supervised fine-tuning to embed specific input-output pairs into the model. This process allows the LLM to produce predetermined outputs when presented with certain inputs, effectively embedding a unique fingerprint. Our method has minimal overhead and impact on model's performance, and does not require white-box access to target model's ownership identification. Compared to existing fingerprinting methods, UTF is also more effective and robust to fine-tuning and random guess.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Exploring Changes in Nation Perception with Nationality-Assigned Personas in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13993v2)**<details>Persona assignment has become a common strategy for customizing LLM use to particular tasks and contexts. In this study, we explore how evaluation of different nations change when LLMs are assigned specific nationality personas. We assign 193 different nationality personas (e.g., an American person) to four LLMs and examine how the LLM evaluations (or ''perceptions'')of countries change. We find that all LLM-persona combinations tend to favor Western European nations, though nation-personas push LLM behaviors to focus more on and treat the nation-persona's own region more favorably. Eastern European, Latin American, and African nations are treated more negatively by different nationality personas. We additionally find that evaluations by nation-persona LLMs of other nations correlate with human survey responses but fail to match the values closely. Our study provides insight into how biases and stereotypes are realized within LLMs when adopting different national personas. In line with the ''Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights'', our findings underscore the critical need for developing mechanisms to ensure that LLM outputs promote fairness and avoid over-generalization.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Pre-print, Under review</details> |
| **[Adaptation Odyssey in LLMs: Why Does Additional Pretraining Sometimes Fail to Improve?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05581v2)**<details>In the last decade, the generalization and adaptation abilities of deep learning models were typically evaluated on fixed training and test distributions. Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models (LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text corpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii) trained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from transferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep learning contexts to LLMs. To this end, our short paper introduces empirical observations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text domain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We observe with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is positively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the original pretraining dataset of the LLM. Our further token-level perplexity observations reveals that the perplexity degradation is due to a handful of tokens that are not informative about the domain. We hope these findings will guide us in determining when to adapt a model vs when to rely on its foundational capabilities.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</details> |
| **[Semantics-Adaptive Activation Intervention for LLMs via Dynamic Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12299v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many tasks, yet aligning them with desired behaviors remains challenging. Activation intervention has emerged as an effective and economical method to modify the behavior of LLMs. Despite considerable interest in this area, current intervention methods exclusively employ a fixed steering vector to modify model activations, lacking adaptability to diverse input semantics. To address this limitation, we propose Semantics-Adaptive Dynamic Intervention (SADI), a novel method that constructs a dynamic steering vector to intervene model activations at inference time. More specifically, SADI utilizes activation differences in contrastive pairs to precisely identify critical elements of an LLM (i.e., attention heads, hidden states, and neurons) for targeted intervention. During inference, SADI dynamically steers model behavior by scaling element-wise activations based on the directions of input semantics. Experimental results show that SADI outperforms established baselines by substantial margins, improving task performance without training. SADI's cost-effectiveness and generalizability across various LLM backbones and tasks highlight its potential as a versatile alignment technique. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line:https://github.com/weixuan-wang123/SADI.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process. Experimental results on datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD, and ActivityNet demonstrate that MERLIN substantially improves Recall@1, outperforming existing systems and confirming the benefits of integrating LLMs into multimodal retrieval systems for more responsive and context-aware multimedia retrieval.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track Accepted (Camera-Ready Version)</details> |
| **[Can LLMs Patch Security Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00024v5)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency in code generation. Unfortunately, these models share a weakness with their human counterparts: producing code that inadvertently has security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized attackers to access sensitive data or systems, which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Feedback-Driven Security Patching (FDSP), where LLMs automatically refine generated, vulnerable code. Our approach leverages automatic static code analysis to empower the LLM to generate and implement potential solutions to address vulnerabilities. We address the research communitys needs for safe code generation by introducing a large-scale dataset, PythonSecurityEval, covering the diversity of real-world applications, including databases, websites and operating systems. We empirically validate that FDSP outperforms prior work that uses self-feedback from LLMs by up to 17.6% through our procedure that injects targeted, external feedback.

| **[A Practice-Friendly LLM-Enhanced Paradigm with Preference Parsing for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00333v2)**<details>The training paradigm integrating large language models (LLM) is gradually reshaping sequential recommender systems (SRS) and has shown promising results. However, most existing LLM-enhanced methods rely on rich textual information on the item side and instance-level supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to inject collaborative information into LLM, which is inefficient and limited in many applications. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a practice-friendly LLM-enhanced paradigm with preference parsing (P2Rec) for SRS. Specifically, in the information reconstruction stage, we design a new user-level SFT task for collaborative information injection with the assistance of a pre-trained SRS model, which is more efficient and compatible with limited text information. Our goal is to let LLM learn to reconstruct a corresponding prior preference distribution from each user's interaction sequence, where LLM needs to effectively parse the latent category of each item and the relationship between different items to accomplish this task. In the information augmentation stage, we feed each item into LLM to obtain a set of enhanced embeddings that combine collaborative information and LLM inference capabilities. These embeddings can then be used to help train various future SRS models. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our TSLRec on three SRS benchmark datasets.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Seeker: Enhancing Exception Handling in Code with LLM-based Multi-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06949v2)**<details>In real world software development, improper or missing exception handling can severely impact the robustness and reliability of code. Exception handling mechanisms require developers to detect, capture, and manage exceptions according to high standards, but many developers struggle with these tasks, leading to fragile code. This problem is particularly evident in open source projects and impacts the overall quality of the software ecosystem. To address this challenge, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to improve exception handling in code. Through extensive analysis, we identify three key issues: Insensitive Detection of Fragile Code, Inaccurate Capture of Exception Types, and Distorted Handling Solutions. These problems are widespread across real world repositories, suggesting that robust exception handling practices are often overlooked or mishandled. In response, we propose Seeker, a multi agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception handling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler to assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more effectively. Our work is the first systematic study on leveraging LLMs to enhance exception handling practices, providing valuable insights for future improvements in code reliability.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>26 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Beyond Demographics: Aligning Role-playing LLM-based Agents Using Human Belief Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17232v2)**<details>Creating human-like large language model (LLM) agents is crucial for faithful social simulation. Having LLMs role-play based on demographic information sometimes improves human likeness but often does not. This study assessed whether LLM alignment with human behavior can be improved by integrating information from empirically-derived human belief networks. Using data from a human survey, we estimated a belief network encompassing 64 topics loading on nine non-overlapping latent factors. We then seeded LLM-based agents with an opinion on one topic, and assessed the alignment of its expressed opinions on remaining test topics with corresponding human data. Role-playing based on demographic information alone did not align LLM and human opinions, but seeding the agent with a single belief greatly improved alignment for topics related in the belief network, and not for topics outside the network. These results suggest a novel path for human-LLM belief alignment in work seeking to simulate and understand patterns of belief distributions in society.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |
| **[Divide-Verify-Refine: Aligning LLM Responses with Complex Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12207v1)**<details>Recent studies show that LLMs, particularly open-source models, struggle to follow complex instructions with multiple constraints. Despite the importance, methods to improve LLMs' adherence to such constraints remain unexplored, and current research focuses on evaluating this ability rather than developing solutions. While a few studies enhance constraint adherence through model tuning, this approach is computationally expensive and heavily reliant on training data quality. An alternative is to leverage LLMs' self-correction capabilities, allowing them to adjust responses to better meet specified constraints. However, this self-correction ability of LLMs is limited by the feedback quality, as LLMs cannot autonomously generate reliable feedback or detect errors. Moreover, the self-refinement process heavily depends on few-shot examples that illustrate how to modify responses to meet constraints. As constraints in complex instructions are diverse and vary widely, manually crafting few-shot examples for each constraint type can be labor-intensive and sub-optimal. To deal with these two challenges, we propose the Divide-Verify-Refine (DVR) framework with three steps: (1) Divide complex instructions into single constraints and prepare appropriate tools; (2) Verify: To address the feedback quality problem, these tools will rigorously verify responses and provide reliable feedback; (3) Refine: To address the constraint diversity challenge, we design a refinement repository that collects successful refinement processes and uses them as few-shot demonstrations for future cases, allowing LLMs to learn from the past experience during inference. Additionally, we develop a new dataset of complex instructions, each containing 1-6 constraints. Experiments show that the framework significantly improves performance, doubling LLama3.1-8B's constraint adherence on instructions with 6 constraints.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Under review</details> |
| **[Beyond Inter-Item Relations: Dynamic Adaption for Enhancing LLM-Based Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07427v2)**<details>Sequential recommender systems (SRS) predict the next items that users may prefer based on user historical interaction sequences. Inspired by the rise of large language models (LLMs) in various AI applications, there is a surge of work on LLM-based SRS. Despite their attractive performance, existing LLM-based SRS still exhibit some limitations, including neglecting intra-item relations, ignoring long-term collaborative knowledge and using inflexible architecture designs for adaption. To alleviate these issues, we propose an LLM-based sequential recommendation model named DARec. Built on top of coarse-grained adaption for capturing inter-item relations, DARec is further enhanced with (1) context masking that models intra-item relations to help LLM better understand token and item semantics in the context of SRS, (2) collaborative knowledge injection that helps LLM incorporate long-term collaborative knowledge, and (3) a dynamic adaption mechanism that uses Bayesian optimization to flexibly choose layer-wise adapter architectures in order to better incorporate different sequential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARec can effectively handle sequential recommendation in a dynamic and adaptive manner.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>11 pages, 14 figures</details> |

However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit weight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited performance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit) activation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving for LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the memory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel fine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most activations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support mixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly optimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data layout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight tensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data loading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming multiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We integrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and provide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a single A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of \textbf{$2.88\times$} over cuBLAS and a \textbf{$2.02 \times$} throughput improvement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>14 pages, 12 figures</details> |
| **[Your Mixture-of-Experts LLM Is Secretly an Embedding Model For Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10814v2)**<details>While large language models (LLMs) excel on generation tasks, their decoder-only architecture often limits their potential as embedding models if no further representation finetuning is applied. Does this contradict their claim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE LLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance on a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any finetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights (RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used embedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of prompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we propose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using either separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy shed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities outperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are conducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement brought by MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Code: https://github.com/tianyi-lab/MoE-Embedding</details> |
| **[IntGrad MT: Eliciting LLMs' Machine Translation Capabilities with Sentence Interpolation and Gradual MT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11693v2)**<details>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in translation without needing to be finetuned on additional parallel corpora. However, they still underperform for low-resource language pairs. Previous works have focused on mitigating this issue by leveraging relevant few-shot examples or external resources such as dictionaries or grammar books, making models heavily reliant on these nonparametric sources of information. In this paper, we propose a novel method named IntGrad MT that focuses on fully exploiting an LLM's inherent translation capability. IntGrad MT achieves this by constructing a chain of few-shot examples, each consisting of a source sentence and the model's own translation, that rise incrementally in difficulty. IntGrad MT employs two techniques: Sentence Interpolation, which generates a sequence of sentences that gradually change from an easy sentence to translate to a difficult one, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates this chain using translations of earlier sentences as few-shot examples for the translation of subsequent ones. With this approach, we observe a substantial enhancement in the xCOMET scores of various LLMs for multiple languages, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi(8.26), Swahili(7.10), Bengali(6.97) and Marathi(13.03). Our approach presents a practical way of enhancing LLMs' performance without extra training.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

Modern deep learning-based retrieval methods have achieved significant results for this problem. However, retrieval systems relying on semantic and lexical correlations often exhibit limitations, particularly when handling queries that involve real-life scenarios, or use the vocabulary that is not specific to the legal domain. In this work, we focus on overcoming this weaknesses by utilizing the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to identify relevant legal terms and facts related to the situation mentioned in the query. The proposed retrieval system integrates additional information from the term--based expansion and query reformulation to improve the retrieval accuracy. The experiments on COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 datasets show that extra knowledge from LLMs helps to improve the retrieval result of both lexical and semantic ranking models. The final ensemble retrieval system outperformed the highest results among all participating teams in the COLIEE 2022 and 2023 competitions.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>Presented at NeLaMKRR@KR, 2024 (arXiv:2410.05339)</details> |

As a sibling project to SafeRLHF and BeaverTails, we separate annotations of helpfulness and harmlessness for question-answering pairs, providing distinct perspectives on these coupled attributes. Overall, we provide 44.6k refined prompts and 265k question-answer pairs with safety meta-labels for 19 harm categories and three severity levels ranging from minor to severe, with answers generated by Llama-family models. Based on this, we collected 166.8k preference data, including dual-preference (helpfulness and harmlessness decoupled) and single-preference data (trade-off the helpfulness and harmlessness from scratch), respectively. Using the large-scale annotation data, we further train severity-sensitive moderation for the risk control of LLMs and safety-centric RLHF algorithms for the safety alignment of LLMs. We believe this dataset will be a valuable resource for the community, aiding in the safe deployment of LLMs.</details> | 2024-10-16 | <details>a sibling project to SafeRLHF and BeaverTails</details> |

In this paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-training compression method that uses seeds of pseudo-random generators to encode and compress model weights. Specifically, for each block of weights, we find a seed that is fed into a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) during inference to efficiently generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses. Unlike state-of-the-art compression methods that rely on calibration data, our approach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Our experiments with Llama 3 70B, which is particularly challenging to compress, show that SeedLM achieves significantly better zero-shot accuracy retention at 4- and 3-bit than state-of-the-art techniques, while maintaining performance comparable to FP16 baselines. Additionally, FPGA-based tests demonstrate that 4-bit SeedLM, as model size increases to 70B, approaches a 4x speed-up over an FP16 Llama 2/3 baseline.</details> | 2024-10-16 |  |

| **[Evaluating LLM-driven User-Intent Formalization for Verification-Aware Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09757v2)**<details>Verification-aware programming languages such as Dafny and F* provide means to formally specify and prove properties of a program. Although the problem of checking an implementation against a specification can be defined mechanically, there is no algorithmic way of ensuring the correctness of the {\it user-intent formalization for programs}, expressed as a formal specification. This is because intent or requirement is expressed {\it informally} in natural language and the specification is a formal artefact. Despite, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has made tremendous strides bridging the gap between informal intent and formal program implementations recently, driven in large parts by benchmarks and automated metrics for evaluation. Recent work has proposed a framework for evaluating the {\it user-intent formalization} problem for mainstream programming languages~\cite{endres-fse24}. However, such an approach does not readily extend to verification-aware languages that support rich specifications (using quantifiers and ghost variables) that cannot be evaluated through dynamic execution. Previous work also required generating program mutants using LLMs to create the benchmark. We advocate an alternate, perhaps simpler approach of {\it symbolically testing specifications} to provide an intuitive metric for evaluating the quality of specifications for verification-aware languages. We demonstrate that our automated metric agrees closely on a human-labeled dataset of Dafny specifications for the popular MBPP code-generation benchmark, yet demonstrates cases where the human labeling is not perfect. We also outline formal verification challenges that need to be addressed to apply the technique more widely. We believe our work provides a stepping stone to enable the establishment of a benchmark and research agenda for the problem of user-intent formalization for programs.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>Proceedings of the 24th Conference on Formal Methods in Computer Aided Design (FMCAD 2024)</details> |

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a common approach used to address this issue. With the demonstrated success of large language models (LLMs) in various NLP tasks, including NER, we propose fine-tuning a specialized Skill-LLM and a light weight model to improve the precision and quality of skill extraction. In our study, we evaluated the fine-tuned Skill-LLM and the light weight model using a benchmark dataset and compared its performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our results show that this approach outperforms existing SOTA techniques.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |
| **[Substance Beats Style: Why Beginning Students Fail to Code with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19792v1)**<details>Although LLMs are increasing the productivity of professional programmers, existing work shows that beginners struggle to prompt LLMs to solve text-to-code tasks. Why is this the case? This paper explores two competing hypotheses about the cause of student-LLM miscommunication: (1) students simply lack the technical vocabulary needed to write good prompts, and (2) students do not understand the extent of information that LLMs need to solve code generation tasks. We study (1) with a causal intervention experiment on technical vocabulary and (2) by analyzing graphs that abstract how students edit prompts and the different failures that they encounter. We find that substance beats style: a poor grasp of technical vocabulary is merely correlated with prompt failure; that the information content of prompts predicts success; that students get stuck making trivial edits; and more. Our findings have implications for the use of LLMs in programming education, and for efforts to make computing more accessible with LLMs.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |
| **[Boosting Logical Fallacy Reasoning in LLMs via Logical Structure Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12048v1)**<details>Logical fallacy uses invalid or faulty reasoning in the construction of a statement. Despite the prevalence and harmfulness of logical fallacies, detecting and classifying logical fallacies still remains a challenging task. We observe that logical fallacies often use connective words to indicate an intended logical relation between two arguments, while the argument semantics does not actually support the logical relation. Inspired by this observation, we propose to build a logical structure tree to explicitly represent and track the hierarchical logic flow among relation connectives and their arguments in a statement. Specifically, this logical structure tree is constructed in an unsupervised manner guided by the constituency tree and a taxonomy of connectives for ten common logical relations, with relation connectives as non-terminal nodes and textual arguments as terminal nodes, and the latter are mostly elementary discourse units. We further develop two strategies to incorporate the logical structure tree into LLMs for fallacy reasoning. Firstly, we transform the tree into natural language descriptions and feed the textualized tree into LLMs as a part of the hard text prompt. Secondly, we derive a relation-aware tree embedding and insert the tree embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach based on logical structure tree significantly improves precision and recall for both fallacy detection and fallacy classification.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>Accepted to EMNLP 2024</details> |
| **[Do LLM Agents Exhibit Social Behavior?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15198v3)**<details>As LLMs increasingly take on roles in human-AI interactions and autonomous AI systems, understanding their social behavior becomes important for informed use and continuous improvement. However, their behaviors in social interactions with humans and other agents, as well as the mechanisms shaping their responses, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework, State-Understanding-Value-Action (SUVA), to systematically analyze LLM responses in social contexts based on their textual outputs (i.e., utterances). Using canonical behavioral economics games and social preference concepts relatable to LLM users, SUVA assesses LLMs' social behavior through both their final decisions and the response generation processes leading to those decisions. Our analysis of eight LLMs -- including two GPT, four LLaMA, and two Mistral models -- suggests that most models do not generate decisions aligned solely with self-interest; instead, they often produce responses that reflect social welfare considerations and display patterns consistent with direct and indirect reciprocity. Additionally, higher-capacity models more frequently display group identity effects. The SUVA framework also provides explainable tools -- including tree-based visualizations and probabilistic dependency analysis -- to elucidate how factors in LLMs' utterance-based reasoning influence their decisions. We demonstrate that utterance-based reasoning reliably predicts LLMs' final actions; references to altruism, fairness, and cooperation in the reasoning increase the likelihood of prosocial actions, while mentions of self-interest and competition reduce them. Overall, our framework enables practitioners to assess LLMs for applications involving social interactions, and provides researchers with a structured method to interpret how LLM behavior arises from utterance-based reasoning.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |

We compared three models: Mistral 7B, SaulLM-7B-Base (Mistral 7B with continued pre-training on legal corpora), and SaulLM-7B-Instruct (with further IFT). This preliminary assessment examined 7 distinct text sequences from recent AI & Law literature, each containing a human-defined legal concept. We first compared the proportions of total attention the models allocated to subsets of tokens representing the legal concepts. We then visualized patterns of raw attention score alterations, evaluating whether legal training introduced novel attention patterns corresponding to structures of human legal knowledge. This inquiry revealed that (1) the impact of legal training was unevenly distributed across the various human-defined legal concepts, and (2) the contextual representations of legal knowledge learned during legal training did not coincide with structures of human-defined legal concepts. We conclude with suggestions for further investigation into the dynamics of legal LLM training.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |

We introduce MMLU-Pro+, an enhanced benchmark building upon MMLU-Pro to assess shortcut learning and higher-order reasoning in LLMs. By incorporating questions with multiple correct answers across diverse domains, MMLU-Pro+ tests LLMs' ability to engage in complex reasoning and resist simplistic problem-solving strategies. Our results show that MMLU-Pro+ maintains MMLU-Pro's difficulty while providing a more rigorous test of model discrimination, particularly in multi-correct answer scenarios. We introduce novel metrics like shortcut selection ratio and correct pair identification ratio, offering deeper insights into model behavior and anchoring bias. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting variations in reasoning abilities and bias susceptibility.

Manually taken notes often miss crucial details due to the fast-paced nature of the content, while automatically generated notes fail to incorporate user preferences and discourage active engagement with the content. To address this, we propose an interactive system, NoTeeline, for supporting real-time, personalized notetaking. Given 'micronotes', NoTeeline automatically expands them into full-fledged notes using Large Language Model (LLM). The generated notes build on the content of micronotes by adding relevant details while maintaining consistency with the user's writing style. In a within-subjects study (n=12), we found that NoTeeline creates high-quality notes that capture the essence of their micronotes with 93.2% factual correctness and accurately align with their writing style (8.33% improvement). Using NoTeeline, participants could capture their desired notes with significantly reduced mental effort, writing 47.0% less text and completing their note in 43.9% less time compared to a manual notetaking baseline. Our results suggest that NoTeeline enables users to integrate LLM assistance in a familiar notetaking workflow while ensuring consistency with their preference.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>Early Draft.

| **[MIND: Math Informed syNthetic Dialogues for Pretraining LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12881v1)**<details>The utility of synthetic data to enhance pretraining data quality and hence to improve downstream task accuracy has been widely explored in recent large language models (LLMs). Yet, these approaches fall inadequate in complex, multi-hop and mathematical reasoning tasks as the synthetic data typically fails to add complementary knowledge to the existing raw corpus. In this work, we propose a novel large-scale and diverse Math Informed syNthetic Dialogue (MIND) generation method that improves the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs. Specifically, using MIND, we generate synthetic conversations based on OpenWebMath (OWM), resulting in a new math corpus, MIND-OWM. Our experiments with different conversational settings reveal that incorporating knowledge gaps between dialog participants is essential for generating high-quality math data. We further identify an effective way to format and integrate synthetic and raw data during pretraining to maximize the gain in mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the need to restructure raw data rather than use it as-is. Compared to pretraining just on raw data, a model pretrained on MIND-OWM shows significant boost in mathematical reasoning (GSM8K: +13.42%, MATH: +2.30%), including superior performance in specialized knowledge (MMLU: +4.55%, MMLU-STEM: +4.28%) and general purpose reasoning tasks (GENERAL REASONING: +2.51%).</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>31 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables</details> |

It can serve as a natural interface for image editing, dramatically improving precision and flexibility. Leveraging this benefit, we introduce a new framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with Text2Image generative model for scene graph-based image editing. This integration enables precise modifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without compromising overall image integrity. Our approach involves two primary stages: 1) Utilizing a LLM-driven scene parser, we construct an image's scene graph, capturing key objects and their interrelationships, as well as parsing fine-grained attributes such as object masks and descriptions. These annotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model, representing each object with an optimized token and detailed description prompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the edits towards specific areas. These edits are then implemented by an attention-modulated diffusion editor, utilizing the fine-tuned model to perform object additions, deletions, replacements, and adjustments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing image editing methods in terms of editing precision and scene aesthetics.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Graphics and SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

Our results show that persona-prompted LLMs produce more diverse annotations than LLMs prompted without personas and that these effects are both controllable and repeatable, making our approach a suitable tool for improving data annotation in subjective NLP tasks like toxicity detection.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>21 pages, 13 figures</details> |

Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>Camera-ready version for Customizable NLP Workshop at EMNLP 2024. 11 pages</details> |

However, their use in data science scenarios requiring solving long-term interconnected tasks, dynamic data adjustments and domain expertise remains challenging. Previous approaches primarily focus on individual tasks, making it difficult to assess the complete data science workflow. Moreover, they struggle to handle real-time changes in intermediate data and fail to adapt dynamically to evolving task dependencies inherent to data science problems. In this paper, we present Data Interpreter, an LLM-based agent designed to automatically solve various data science problems end-to-end. Our Data Interpreter incorporates two key modules: 1) Hierarchical Graph Modeling, which breaks down complex problems into manageable subproblems, enabling dynamic node generation and graph optimization; and 2) Programmable Node Generation, a technique that refines and verifies each subproblem to iteratively improve code generation results and robustness. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of Data Interpreter. On InfiAgent-DABench, it achieves a 25% performance boost, raising accuracy from 75.9% to 94.9%. For machine learning and open-ended tasks, it improves performance from 88% to 95%, and from 60% to 97%, respectively. Moreover, on the MATH dataset, Data Interpreter achieves remarkable performance with a 26% improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons.

The internal validity of these benchmarks - i.e., making sure they are free from confounding factors - is crucial for ensuring that they are measuring what they are designed to measure. In this paper, we explore a key issue related to internal validity: the possibility that AI systems can solve benchmarks in unintended ways, bypassing the capability being tested. This phenomenon, widely known in human and animal experiments, is often referred to as the 'Clever Hans' effect, where tasks are solved using spurious cues, often involving much simpler processes than those putatively assessed. Previous research suggests that language models can exhibit this behaviour as well. In several older Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, individual $n$-grams like "not" have been found to be highly predictive of the correct labels, and supervised NLP models have been shown to exploit these patterns. In this work, we investigate the extent to which simple $n$-grams extracted from benchmark instances can be combined to predict labels in modern multiple-choice benchmarks designed for LLMs, and whether LLMs might be using such $n$-gram patterns to solve these benchmarks. We show how simple classifiers trained on these $n$-grams can achieve high scores on several benchmarks, despite lacking the capabilities being tested. Additionally, we provide evidence that modern LLMs might be using these superficial patterns to solve benchmarks. This suggests that the internal validity of these benchmarks may be compromised and caution should be exercised when interpreting LLM performance results on them.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |

We address the challenge of quantifying the uncertainty of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. While uncertainty quantification has been well-studied in other domains, applying it effectively to LLMs poses unique challenges due to their complex decision-making capabilities and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for quantifying uncertainty designed to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. The method quantifies uncertainty by analyzing the relationships between generated assessments and possible ratings. By cross-evaluating these relationships and constructing a confusion matrix based on token probabilities, the method derives labels of high or low uncertainty. We evaluate our method across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating a strong correlation between the accuracy of LLM evaluations and the derived uncertainty scores. Our findings suggest that this method can significantly improve the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |

While Knowledge Graphs~(KGs) have been shown to help mitigate these issues, research on the integration of LLMs with background KGs remains limited. In particular, user accessibility and the flexibility of the underlying KG have not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AGENTiGraph (Adaptive Generative ENgine for Task-based Interaction and Graphical Representation), a platform for knowledge management through natural language interaction. It integrates knowledge extraction, integration, and real-time visualization. AGENTiGraph employs a multi-agent architecture to dynamically interpret user intents, manage tasks, and integrate new knowledge, ensuring adaptability to evolving user requirements and data contexts. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in knowledge graph interactions, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. Experimental results on a dataset of 3,500 test cases show AGENTiGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines, achieving 95.12\% accuracy in task classification and 90.45\% success rate in task execution. User studies corroborate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To showcase versatility, we extended AGENTiGraph to legislation and healthcare domains, constructing specialized KGs capable of answering complex queries in legal and medical contexts.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>30 pages, 7 figures; Submitted to COLING 2025 System Demonstrations Track</details> |

The consistency of the proposed emotion lexicon in emotion extraction was assessed through modification and utilization of three distinct emotion text datasets. This study not only validates the efficacy of the constructed lexicon but also emphasizes that collaborative annotation between human and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the quality of emotion labels, highlighting the potential of such partnerships in facilitating natural language processing tasks for low-resource languages.</details> | 2024-10-15 | <details>13 pages</details> |

Meanwhile, an automatic pipeline is designed to distill human preferences into smaller Machine Translation (MT) models for efficiently and economically supporting large-scale calls in online services. Experiments indicate that the proposed method takes the lead in translation tasks with aligned human preferences by a large margin. Meanwhile, on popular public benchmarks like WMT and Flores, on which our models were not trained, the proposed method also shows a competitive performance compared to SOTA works.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |

Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.</details> | 2024-10-15 |  |
