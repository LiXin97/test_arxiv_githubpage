| **[Empirical Analysis of the Strengths and Weaknesses of PEFT Techniques for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14999v1)**<details>As foundation models continue to exponentially scale in size, efficient methods of adaptation become increasingly critical. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), a recent class of techniques that require only modifying a small percentage of the model parameters, is currently the most popular method for adapting large language models (LLMs). Several PEFT techniques have recently been proposed with varying tradeoffs. We provide a comprehensive and uniform benchmark of various PEFT techniques across a representative LLM, the FLAN-T5 model, and evaluate model performance across different data scales of classification and generation datasets. Based on this, we provide a framework for choosing the optimal fine-tuning techniques given the task type and data availability. Contrary to popular belief, we also empirically prove that PEFT techniques converge slower than full tuning in low data scenarios, and posit the amount of data required for PEFT methods to both perform well and converge efficiently. Lastly, we further optimize these PEFT techniques by selectively choosing which parts of the model to train, and find that these techniques can be applied with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining and even improving performance.</details> | 2023-04-28 | <details>Short paper, ICLR '23 Workshop on Understanding Foundation Models</details> |
| **[Harnessing the Power of LLMs in Practice: A Survey on ChatGPT and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13712v2)**<details>This paper presents a comprehensive and practical guide for practitioners and end-users working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in their downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We provide discussions and insights into the usage of LLMs from the perspectives of models, data, and downstream tasks. Firstly, we offer an introduction and brief summary of current GPT- and BERT-style LLMs. Then, we discuss the influence of pre-training data, training data, and test data. Most importantly, we provide a detailed discussion about the use and non-use cases of large language models for various natural language processing tasks, such as knowledge-intensive tasks, traditional natural language understanding tasks, natural language generation tasks, emergent abilities, and considerations for specific tasks.We present various use cases and non-use cases to illustrate the practical applications and limitations of LLMs in real-world scenarios. We also try to understand the importance of data and the specific challenges associated with each NLP task. Furthermore, we explore the impact of spurious biases on LLMs and delve into other essential considerations, such as efficiency, cost, and latency, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of deploying LLMs in practice. This comprehensive guide aims to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights and best practices for working with LLMs, thereby enabling the successful implementation of these models in a wide range of NLP tasks.

| **[Origin Tracing and Detecting of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14072v1)**<details>The extraordinary performance of large language models (LLMs) heightens the importance of detecting whether the context is generated by an AI system. More importantly, while more and more companies and institutions release their LLMs, the origin can be hard to trace. Since LLMs are heading towards the time of AGI, similar to the origin tracing in anthropology, it is of great importance to trace the origin of LLMs. In this paper, we first raise the concern of the origin tracing of LLMs and propose an effective method to trace and detect AI-generated contexts. We introduce a novel algorithm that leverages the contrastive features between LLMs and extracts model-wise features to trace the text origins. Our proposed method works under both white-box and black-box settings therefore can be widely generalized to detect various LLMs.(e.g. can be generalized to detect GPT-3 models without the GPT-3 models). Also, our proposed method requires only limited data compared with the supervised learning methods and can be extended to trace new-coming model origins. We construct extensive experiments to examine whether we can trace the origins of given texts. We provide valuable observations based on the experimental results, such as the difficulty level of AI origin tracing, and the AI origin similarities, and call for ethical concerns of LLM providers. We are releasing all codes and data as a toolkit and benchmark for future AI origin tracing and detecting studies. \footnote{We are releasing all available resource at \url{https://github.com/OpenLMLab/}.}</details> | 2023-04-27 | <details>working in progress</details> |
| **[Augmenting Interpretable Models with LLMs during Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11799v3)**<details>Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prediction performance for a growing array of tasks. However, their proliferation into high-stakes domains (e.g. medicine) and compute-limited settings has created a burgeoning need for interpretability and efficiency. We address this need by proposing Augmented Interpretable Models (Aug-imodels), a framework for leveraging the knowledge learned by LLMs to build extremely efficient and interpretable models. Aug-imodels use LLMs during fitting but not during inference, allowing complete transparency and often a speed/memory improvement of greater than 1,000x for inference compared to LLMs. We explore two instantiations of Aug-imodels in natural-language processing: (i) Aug-GAM, which augments a generalized additive model with decoupled embeddings from an LLM and (ii) Aug-Tree, which augments a decision tree with LLM feature expansions. Across a variety of text-classification datasets, both outperform their non-augmented counterparts. Aug-GAM can even outperform much larger models (e.g. a 6-billion parameter GPT-J model), despite having 10,000x fewer parameters and being fully transparent. We further explore Aug-imodels in a natural-language fMRI study, where they generate interesting interpretations from scientific data. All code for using Aug-imodels and reproducing results is made available on Github.</details> | 2023-04-25 |  |
| **[Unlocking Context Constraints of LLMs: Enhancing Context Efficiency of LLMs with Self-Information-Based Content Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12102v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have received significant attention by achieving remarkable performance across various tasks. However, their fixed context length poses challenges when processing long documents or maintaining extended conversations. This paper proposes a method called \textit{Selective Context} that employs self-information to filter out less informative content, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the fixed context length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on tasks of summarisation and question answering across different data sources, including academic papers, news articles, and conversation transcripts.</details> | 2023-04-24 |  |
| **[Who's the Best Detective? LLMs vs. MLs in Detecting Incoherent Fourth Grade Math Answers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11257v1)**<details>Written answers to open-ended questions can have a higher long-term effect on learning than multiple-choice questions. However, it is critical that teachers immediately review the answers, and ask to redo those that are incoherent. This can be a difficult task and can be time-consuming for teachers. A possible solution is to automate the detection of incoherent answers. One option is to automate the review with Large Language Models (LLM). In this paper, we analyze the responses of fourth graders in mathematics using three LLMs: GPT-3, BLOOM, and YOU. We used them with zero, one, two, three and four shots. We compared their performance with the results of various classifiers trained with Machine Learning (ML). We found that LLMs perform worse than MLs in detecting incoherent answers. The difficulty seems to reside in recursive questions that contain both questions and answers, and in responses from students with typical fourth-grader misspellings. Upon closer examination, we have found that the ChatGPT model faces the same challenges.</details> | 2023-04-21 |  |
| **[LLM-based Interaction for Content Generation: A Case Study on the Perception of Employees in an IT department](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09064v1)**<details>In the past years, AI has seen many advances in the field of NLP. This has led to the emergence of LLMs, such as the now famous GPT-3.5, which revolutionise the way humans can access or generate content. Current studies on LLM-based generative tools are mainly interested in the performance of such tools in generating relevant content (code, text or image). However, ethical concerns related to the design and use of generative tools seem to be growing, impacting the public acceptability for specific tasks. This paper presents a questionnaire survey to identify the intention to use generative tools by employees of an IT company in the context of their work. This survey is based on empirical models measuring intention to use (TAM by Davis, 1989, and UTAUT2 by Venkatesh and al., 2008). Our results indicate a rather average acceptability of generative tools, although the more useful the tool is perceived to be, the higher the intention to use seems to be. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that the frequency of use of generative tools is likely to be a key factor in understanding how employees perceive these tools in the context of their work. Following on from this work, we plan to investigate the nature of the requests that may be made to these tools by specific audiences.</details> | 2023-04-18 | <details>14 pages (bibliography inclued), 6 figures, preprint submitted to Work-In-Progress session of ACM IMX'23 Interactive Media Experience</details> |
| **[Stochastic Parrots Looking for Stochastic Parrots: LLMs are Easy to Fine-Tune and Hard to Detect with other LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08968v1)**<details>The self-attention revolution allowed generative language models to scale and achieve increasingly impressive abilities. Such models - commonly referred to as Large Language Models (LLMs) - have recently gained prominence with the general public, thanks to conversational fine-tuning, putting their behavior in line with public expectations regarding AI. This prominence amplified prior concerns regarding the misuse of LLMs and led to the emergence of numerous tools to detect LLMs in the wild. Unfortunately, most such tools are critically flawed. While major publications in the LLM detectability field suggested that LLMs were easy to detect with fine-tuned autoencoders, the limitations of their results are easy to overlook. Specifically, they assumed publicly available generative models without fine-tunes or non-trivial prompts. While the importance of these assumptions has been demonstrated, until now, it remained unclear how well such detection could be countered. Here, we show that an attacker with access to such detectors' reference human texts and output not only evades detection but can fully frustrate the detector training - with a reasonable budget and all its outputs labeled as such. Achieving it required combining common "reinforcement from critic" loss function modification and AdamW optimizer, which led to surprisingly good fine-tuning generalization. Finally, we warn against the temptation to transpose the conclusions obtained in RNN-driven text GANs to LLMs due to their better representative ability. These results have critical implications for the detection and prevention of malicious use of generative language models, and we hope they will aid the designers of generative models and detectors.</details> | 2023-04-18 | <details>15 pages, 6 figures; 10 pages, 7 figures Supplementary Materials; under review at ECML 2023</details> |
| **[Does Synthetic Data Generation of LLMs Help Clinical Text Mining?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04360v2)**<details>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of highly potent models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. These models have exhibited exceptional performance in a variety of tasks, such as question answering, essay composition, and code generation. However, their effectiveness in the healthcare sector remains uncertain. In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of ChatGPT to aid in clinical text mining by examining its ability to extract structured information from unstructured healthcare texts, with a focus on biological named entity recognition and relation extraction. However, our preliminary results indicate that employing ChatGPT directly for these tasks resulted in poor performance and raised privacy concerns associated with uploading patients' information to the ChatGPT API. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new training paradigm that involves generating a vast quantity of high-quality synthetic data with labels utilizing ChatGPT and fine-tuning a local model for the downstream task. Our method has resulted in significant improvements in the performance of downstream tasks, improving the F1-score from 23.37% to 63.99% for the named entity recognition task and from 75.86% to 83.59% for the relation extraction task. Furthermore, generating data using ChatGPT can significantly reduce the time and effort required for data collection and labeling, as well as mitigate data privacy concerns. In summary, the proposed framework presents a promising solution to enhance the applicability of LLM models to clinical text mining.</details> | 2023-04-10 | <details>10 pages, 8 tables, 4 figures</details> |
| **[Chat-REC: Towards Interactive and Explainable LLMs-Augmented Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14524v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their significant potential to be applied for addressing various application tasks. However, traditional recommender systems continue to face great challenges such as poor interactivity and explainability, which actually also hinder their broad deployment in real-world systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel paradigm called Chat-Rec (ChatGPT Augmented Recommender System) that innovatively augments LLMs for building conversational recommender systems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts. Chat-Rec is demonstrated to be effective in learning user preferences and establishing connections between users and products through in-context learning, which also makes the recommendation process more interactive and explainable. What's more, within the Chat-Rec framework, user's preferences can transfer to different products for cross-domain recommendations, and prompt-based injection of information into LLMs can also handle the cold-start scenarios with new items. In our experiments, Chat-Rec effectively improve the results of top-k recommendations and performs better in zero-shot rating prediction task. Chat-Rec offers a novel approach to improving recommender systems and presents new practical scenarios for the implementation of AIGC (AI generated content) in recommender system studies.</details> | 2023-04-04 |  |
