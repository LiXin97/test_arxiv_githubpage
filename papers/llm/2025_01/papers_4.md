| **[U-MATH: A University-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Skills in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03205v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current evaluation of mathematical skills in LLMs is limited, as existing benchmarks are either relatively small, primarily focus on elementary and high-school problems, or lack diversity in topics. Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored. To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release $\mu$-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions. The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on $\mu$-MATH.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Exploring Robustness of Multilingual LLMs on Real-World Noisy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08322v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on Web data that might contain spelling errors made by humans. But do they become robust to similar real-world noise? In this paper, we investigate the effect of real-world spelling mistakes on the performance of 9 language models, with parameters ranging from 0.2B to 13B, in 3 different NLP tasks, namely Natural Language Inference (NLI), Name Entity Recognition (NER), and Intent Classification (IC). We perform our experiments on 6 different languages and build a dictionary of real-world noise for them using the Wikipedia edit history. We show that the performance gap of the studied models on the clean and noisy test data averaged across all the datasets and languages ranges from 2.3 to 4.3 absolute percentage points. In addition, mT5 models, in general, show more robustness compared to BLOOM, Falcon, and BERT-like models. In particular, mT5 (13B), was the most robust on average overall, across the 3 tasks, and in 4 of the 6 languages.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[HALoGEN: Fantastic LLM Hallucinations and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive ability to generate high-quality and fluent text, generative large language models (LLMs) also produce hallucinations: statements that are misaligned with established world knowledge or provided input context. However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). We further define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based on whether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type A errors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or are fabrication (Type C errors). We hope our framework provides a foundation to enable the principled study of why generative models hallucinate, and advances the development of trustworthy large language models.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | Preprint |
| **[Exploring Robustness of LLMs to Sociodemographically-Conditioned Paraphrasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08276v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks. However, there are concerns about their reliability in different domains of linguistic variations. Many works have proposed robustness evaluation measures for local adversarial attacks, but we need globally robust models unbiased to different language styles. We take a broader approach to explore a wider range of variations across sociodemographic dimensions to perform structured reliability tests on the reasoning capacity of language models. We extend the SocialIQA dataset to create diverse paraphrased sets conditioned on sociodemographic styles. The assessment aims to provide a deeper understanding of LLMs in (a) their capability of generating demographic paraphrases with engineered prompts and (b) their reasoning capabilities in real-world, complex language scenarios. We also explore measures such as perplexity, explainability, and ATOMIC performance of paraphrases for fine-grained reliability analysis of LLMs on these sets. We find that demographic-specific paraphrasing significantly impacts the performance of language models, indicating that the subtleties of language variations remain a significant challenge. The code and dataset will be made available for reproducibility and future research.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Addressing the sustainable AI trilemma: a case study on LLM agents and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08262v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, but their widespread deployment and more advanced applications raise critical sustainability challenges, particularly in inference energy consumption. We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Towards Best Practices for Open Datasets for LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08365v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many AI companies are training their large language models (LLMs) on data without the permission of the copyright owners. The permissibility of doing so varies by jurisdiction: in countries like the EU and Japan, this is allowed under certain restrictions, while in the United States, the legal landscape is more ambiguous. Regardless of the legal status, concerns from creative producers have led to several high-profile copyright lawsuits, and the threat of litigation is commonly cited as a reason for the recent trend towards minimizing the information shared about training datasets by both corporate and public interest actors. This trend in limiting data information causes harm by hindering transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader ecosystem by denying researchers, auditors, and impacted individuals access to the information needed to understand AI models. While this could be mitigated by training language models on open access and public domain data, at the time of writing, there are no such models (trained at a meaningful scale) due to the substantial technical and sociological challenges in assembling the necessary corpus. These challenges include incomplete and unreliable metadata, the cost and complexity of digitizing physical records, and the diverse set of legal and technical skills required to ensure relevance and responsibility in a quickly changing landscape. Building towards a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards, digitization, and fostering a culture of openness.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Investigating Energy Efficiency and Performance Trade-offs in LLM Inference Across Tasks and DVFS Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08219v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant improvements in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, accelerating their rapid adoption across many industries. These models are resource-intensive, requiring extensive computational resources both during training and inference, leading to increased energy consumption and negative environmental impact. As their adoption accelerates, the sustainability of LLMs has become a critical issue, necessitating strategies to optimize their runtime efficiency without compromising performance. Hence, it is imperative to identify the parameters that significantly influence the performance and energy efficiency of LLMs. To that end, in this work, we investigate the effect of important parameters on the performance and energy efficiency of LLMs during inference and examine their trade-offs. First, we analyze how different types of models with varying numbers of parameters and architectures perform on tasks like text generation, question answering, and summarization by benchmarking LLMs such as Falcon-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, T5-3B, GPT-2, GPT-J-6B, and GPT-Neo-2.7B. Second, we study input and output sequence characteristics such as sequence length concerning energy consumption, performance, and throughput. Finally, we explore the impact of hardware-based power-saving techniques, i.e., Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS), on the models' latency and energy efficiency. Our extensive benchmarking and statistical analysis reveal many interesting findings, uncovering how specific optimizations can reduce energy consumption while maintaining throughput and accuracy. This study provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners to design energy-efficient LLM inference systems.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[ArithmAttack: Evaluating Robustness of LLMs to Noisy Context in Math Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08203v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in math problem-solving tasks, their robustness to noisy inputs is not well-studied. In this work, we propose ArithmAttack to examine how robust the LLMs are when they encounter noisy prompts that contain extra noise in the form of punctuation marks. While being easy to implement, ArithmAttack does not cause any information loss since words are not added or deleted from the context. We evaluate the robustness of seven LLMs, including LLama3, Mistral, and Mathstral, on noisy GSM8K and MultiArith datasets. Our experiments suggest that all the studied models show vulnerability to such noise, with more noise leading to poorer performances.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Personalized LLM Response Generation with Parameterized Memory Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03565v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language. On the other hand, personalized LLM response generation holds the potential to offer substantial benefits for individuals in critical areas such as medical. Existing research has explored memory-augmented methods to prompt the LLM with pre-stored user-specific knowledge for personalized response generation in terms of new queries. We contend that such paradigm is unable to perceive fine-granularity information. In this study, we propose a novel \textbf{M}emory-\textbf{i}njected approach using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and along with a Bayesian Optimisation searching strategy to achieve \textbf{L}LM \textbf{P}ersonalization(\textbf{MiLP}).</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[CWEval: Outcome-driven Evaluation on Functionality and Security of LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08200v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly aided developers by generating or assisting in code writing, enhancing productivity across various tasks. While identifying incorrect code is often straightforward, detecting vulnerabilities in functionally correct code is more challenging, especially for developers with limited security knowledge, which poses considerable security risks of using LLM-generated code and underscores the need for robust evaluation benchmarks that assess both functional correctness and security. Current benchmarks like CyberSecEval and SecurityEval attempt to solve it but are hindered by unclear and impractical specifications, failing to assess both functionality and security accurately. To tackle these deficiencies, we introduce CWEval, a novel outcome-driven evaluation framework designed to enhance the evaluation of secure code generation by LLMs. This framework not only assesses code functionality but also its security simultaneously with high-quality task specifications and outcome-driven test oracles which provides high accuracy. Coupled with CWEval-bench, a multilingual, security-critical coding benchmark, CWEval provides a rigorous empirical security evaluation on LLM-generated code, overcoming previous benchmarks' shortcomings. Through our evaluations, CWEval reveals a notable portion of functional but insecure code produced by LLMs, and shows a serious inaccuracy of previous evaluations, ultimately contributing significantly to the field of secure code generation. We open-source our artifact at: https://github.com/Co1lin/CWEval .</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in LLM4Code 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenCSG Chinese Corpus: A Series of High-quality Chinese Datasets for LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08197v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their success heavily relies on the quality of pretraining corpora. For Chinese LLMs, the scarcity of high-quality Chinese datasets presents a significant challenge, often limiting their performance. To address this issue, we propose the OpenCSG Chinese Corpus, a series of high-quality datasets specifically designed for LLM pretraining, post-training, and fine-tuning. This corpus includes Fineweb-edu-chinese, Fineweb-edu-chinese-v2, Cosmopedia-chinese, and Smoltalk-chinese, each with distinct characteristics: Fineweb-edu datasets focus on filtered, high-quality content derived from diverse Chinese web sources; Cosmopedia-chinese provides synthetic, textbook-style data for knowledge-intensive training; and Smoltalk-chinese emphasizes stylistic and diverse chat-format data. The OpenCSG Chinese Corpus is characterized by its high-quality text, diverse coverage across domains, and scalable, reproducible data curation processes. Additionally, we conducted extensive experimental analyses, including evaluations on smaller parameter models, which demonstrated significant performance improvements in tasks such as C-Eval, showcasing the effectiveness of the corpus for training Chinese LLMs.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The datasets are available on https://huggingface.co/collections/opencsg/chinese-fineweb-66cfed105f502ece8f29643e ; The code is on https://github.com/yuyijiong/fineweb-edu-chinese</p></details> |
| **[PRESERVE: Prefetching Model Weights and KV-Cache in Distributed LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08192v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely used across various applications, but their substantial computational requirements pose significant challenges, particularly in terms of HBM bandwidth bottlenecks and inter-device communication overhead. In this paper, we present PRESERVE, a novel prefetching framework designed to optimize LLM inference by overlapping memory reads for model weights and KV-cache with collective communication operations. Through extensive experiments conducted on commercial AI accelerators, we demonstrate up to 1.6x end-to-end speedup on state-of-the-art, open-source LLMs. Additionally, we perform a design space exploration that identifies the optimal hardware configuration for the proposed method, showing a further 1.25x improvement in performance per cost by selecting the optimal L2 cache size. Our results show that PRESERVE has the potential to mitigate the memory bottlenecks and communication overheads, offering a solution to improve the performance and scalability of the LLM inference systems.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[WebWalker: Benchmarking LLMs in Web Traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07572v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrates remarkable performance across tasks in open-domain question-answering. However, traditional search engines may retrieve shallow content, limiting the ability of LLMs to handle complex, multi-layered information. To address it, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Inductive Learning of Logical Theories with LLMs: An Expressivity-Graded Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16779v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel systematic methodology to analyse the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) with feedback from a formal inference engine, on logic theory induction. The analysis is complexity-graded w.r.t. rule dependency structure, allowing quantification of specific inference challenges on LLM performance. Integrating LLMs with formal methods is a promising frontier in the Natural Language Processing field, as an important avenue for improving model inference control and explainability. In particular, inductive learning over complex sets of facts and rules, poses unique challenges for current autoregressive models, as they lack explicit symbolic grounding. While they can be complemented by formal systems, the properties delivered by LLMs regarding inductive learning, are not well understood and quantified. Empirical results indicate that the largest LLMs can achieve competitive results against a SOTA Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system baseline, but also that tracking long predicate relationship chains is a more difficult obstacle than theory complexity for LLMs.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Are LLMs Good Literature Review Writers? Evaluating the Literature Review Writing Ability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13612v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The literature review is a crucial form of academic writing that involves complex processes of literature collection, organization, and summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced promising tools to automate these processes. However, their actual capabilities in writing comprehensive literature reviews remain underexplored, such as whether they can generate accurate and reliable references. To address this gap, we propose a framework to assess the literature review writing ability of LLMs automatically. We evaluate the performance of LLMs across three tasks: generating references, writing abstracts, and writing literature reviews. We employ external tools for a multidimensional evaluation, which includes assessing hallucination rates in references, semantic coverage, and factual consistency with human-written context. By analyzing the experimental results, we find that, despite advancements, even the most sophisticated models still cannot avoid generating hallucinated references. Additionally, different models exhibit varying performance in literature review writing across different disciplines.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Roadmap to Guide the Integration of LLMs in Hierarchical Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08068v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) are fostering their integration into several reasoning-related fields, including Automated Planning (AP). However, their integration into Hierarchical Planning (HP), a subfield of AP that leverages hierarchical knowledge to enhance planning performance, remains largely unexplored. In this preliminary work, we propose a roadmap to address this gap and harness the potential of LLMs for HP. To this end, we present a taxonomy of integration methods, exploring how LLMs can be utilized within the HP life cycle. Additionally, we provide a benchmark with a standardized dataset for evaluating the performance of future LLM-based HP approaches, and present initial results for a state-of-the-art HP planner and LLM planner. As expected, the latter exhibits limited performance (3\% correct plans, and none with a correct hierarchical decomposition) but serves as a valuable baseline for future approaches.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 0 figures, to be published in the AAAI Workshop on Planning in the Era of LLMs ( https://llmforplanning.github.io )</p></details> |
| **[Audio-Agent: Leveraging LLMs For Audio Generation, Editing and Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03335v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Audio-Agent, a multimodal framework for audio generation, editing and composition based on text or video inputs. Conventional approaches for text-to-audio (TTA) tasks often make single-pass inferences from text descriptions. While straightforward, this design struggles to produce high-quality audio when given complex text conditions. In our method, we utilize a pre-trained TTA diffusion network as the audio generation agent to work in tandem with GPT-4, which decomposes the text condition into atomic, specific instructions and calls the agent for audio generation. In doing so, Audio-Agent can generate high-quality audio that is closely aligned with the provided text or video exhibiting complex and multiple events, while supporting variable-length and variable-volume generation. For video-to-audio (VTA) tasks, most existing methods require training a timestamp detector to synchronize video events with the generated audio, a process that can be tedious and time-consuming. Instead, we propose a simpler approach by fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), e.g., Gemma2-2B-it, to obtain both semantic and temporal conditions that bridge the video and audio modality. Consequently, our framework contributes a comprehensive solution for both TTA and VTA tasks without substantial computational overhead in training.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[Gandalf the Red: Adaptive Security for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07927v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and rigorously expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack datasets. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/lakeraai/dsec-gandalf}{\texttt{https://github.com/lakeraai/dsec-gandalf}}.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Nikla...</summary><p>Niklas Pfister, V\'aclav Volhejn and Manuel Knott contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Metamemory Mechanisms for Enhanced Data-Free Code Generation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07892v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code generation using large language models (LLMs) has gained attention due to its efficiency and adaptability. However, real-world coding tasks or benchmarks like HumanEval and StudentEval often lack dedicated training datasets, challenging existing few-shot prompting approaches that rely on reference examples. Inspired by human metamemory-a cognitive process involving recall and evaluation-we present a novel framework (namely M^2WF) for improving LLMs' one-time code generation. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously generate, evaluate, and utilize synthetic examples to enhance reliability and performance. Unlike prior methods, it minimizes dependency on curated data and adapts flexibly to various coding scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in coding benchmarks, offering a scalable and robust solution for data-free environments. The code and framework will be publicly available on GitHub and HuggingFace.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | 11 pages,6 figures |
| **[FLM-101B: An Open LLM and How to Train It with $100K Budget](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03852v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are considered important approaches towards foundational machine intelligence, achieving remarkable success in Natural Language Processing and multimodal tasks, among others. However, the carbon footprints and financial costs originating from heavy pre-training computation is a non-negligible issue. Progressive training methods, inspired by the neurogenesis process that grows neural structures, have shown potential to accelerate LLM pre-training. However, the algorithms, implementation, and practices for progressively training LLMs beyond 100B parameters remain underexplored. In this paper, we show that our model, namely FLM-101B, trained with our growth strategy under a budget of \$100K, reaches 80\% of the baselines' performances with only 10\% of their floating-point operations. We believe that further studies on progressive training will benefit the community by cutting down the costs and promoting green AI. The checkpoint of FLM-101B is released at https://huggingface.co/CofeAI/FLM-101B.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |

Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor performance on this task. In this paper, we establish the benchmark results for three popular LLMs: Gemma2, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT, showing that their performance on this task is still significantly below that of humans. We also investigate why these models struggle to achieve superior performance. We release our code and introduced datasets at https://github.com/bodasadallah/decrypting-crosswords.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.12094</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Repository-Level Code Summarization for Business Applications Using Local LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07857v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-scale software development, understanding the functionality and intent behind complex codebases is critical for effective development and maintenance. While code summarization has been widely studied, existing methods primarily focus on smaller code units, such as functions, and struggle with larger code artifacts like files and packages. Additionally, current summarization models tend to emphasize low-level implementation details, often overlooking the domain and business context that are crucial for real-world applications. This paper proposes a two-step hierarchical approach for repository-level code summarization, tailored to business applications. First, smaller code units such as functions and variables are identified using syntax analysis and summarized with local LLMs. These summaries are then aggregated to generate higher-level file and package summaries. To ensure the summaries are grounded in business context, we design custom prompts that capture the intended purpose of code artifacts based on the domain and problem context of the business application. We evaluate our approach on a business support system (BSS) for the telecommunications domain, showing that syntax analysis-based hierarchical summarization improves coverage, while business-context grounding enhances the relevance of the generated summaries.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at LLM4Code@ICSE 2025</p></details> |

This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step processes, such as logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, where understanding implicit relationships between entities and leveraging multi-hop connections in the given context are crucial. Graphs, as fundamental data structures, explicitly represent pairwise relationships between entities, thereby offering the potential to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. External graphs have proven effective in supporting LLMs across multiple tasks. However, in many reasoning tasks, no pre-existing graph structure is provided. Can we structure implicit knowledge derived from context into graphs to assist LLMs in reasoning? In this paper, we propose Reasoning with Graphs (RwG) by first constructing explicit graphs from the context and then leveraging these graphs to enhance LLM reasoning performance on reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering tasks.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[CodeCoR: An LLM-Based Self-Reflective Multi-Agent Framework for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07811v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation aims to produce code that fulfills requirements written in natural languages automatically. Large language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated promising effectiveness in this area. Nonetheless, these LLMs often fail to ensure the syntactic and semantic correctness of the generated code. Recently, researchers proposed multi-agent frameworks that guide LLMs with different prompts to analyze programming tasks, generate code, perform testing in a sequential workflow. However, the performance of the workflow is not robust as the code generation depends on the performance of each agent. To address this challenge, we propose CodeCoR, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that evaluates the effectiveness of each agent and their collaborations. Specifically, for a given task description, four agents in CodeCoR generate prompts, code, test cases, and repair advice, respectively. Each agent generates more than one output and prunes away the low-quality ones. The generated code is tested in the local environment: the code that fails to pass the generated test cases is sent to the repair agent and the coding agent re-generates the code based on repair advice. Finally, the code that passes the most number of generated test cases is returned to users. Our experiments on four widely used datasets, HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET, demonstrate that CodeCoR significantly outperforms existing baselines (e.g., CodeCoT and MapCoder), achieving an average Pass@1 score of 77.8%.</p></details> | 2025-01-14 |  |
| **[LLM Reading Tea Leaves: Automatically Evaluating Topic Models with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09008v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topic modeling has been a widely used tool for unsupervised text analysis. However, comprehensive evaluations of a topic model remain challenging. Existing evaluation methods are either less comparable across different models (e.g., perplexity) or focus on only one specific aspect of a model (e.g., topic quality or document representation quality) at a time, which is insufficient to reflect the overall model performance. In this paper, we propose WALM (Word Agreement with Language Model), a new evaluation method for topic modeling that considers the semantic quality of document representations and topics in a joint manner, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). With extensive experiments involving different types of topic models, WALM is shown to align with human judgment and can serve as a complementary evaluation method to the existing ones, bringing a new perspective to topic modeling.

| **[Scideator: Human-LLM Scientific Idea Generation Grounded in Research-Paper Facet Recombination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14634v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects of existing papers to create new ideas. To see if large language models (LLMs) can assist this process, we contribute Scideator, a novel mixed-initiative tool for scientific ideation. Starting from a user-provided set of papers, Scideator extracts key facets (purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations) from these and relevant papers, allowing users to explore the idea space by interactively recombining facets to synthesize inventive ideas. Scideator also helps users to gauge idea novelty by searching the literature for potential overlaps and showing automated novelty assessments and explanations. To support these tasks, Scideator introduces four LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) modules: Analogous Paper Facet Finder, Faceted Idea Generator, Idea Novelty Checker, and Idea Novelty Iterator.

| **[Enhancing Talent Employment Insights Through Feature Extraction with LLM Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07663v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) to extract nuanced and complex job features from unstructured job postings. Using a dataset of 1.2 million job postings provided by AdeptID, we developed a robust pipeline to identify and classify variables such as remote work availability, remuneration structures, educational requirements, and work experience preferences. Our methodology combines semantic chunking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning DistilBERT models to overcome the limitations of traditional parsing tools. By leveraging these techniques, we achieved significant improvements in identifying variables often mislabeled or overlooked, such as non-salary-based compensation and inferred remote work categories. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our fine-tuned models and analyze their strengths, limitations, and potential for scaling. This work highlights the promise of LLMs in labor market analytics, providing a foundation for more accurate and actionable insights into job data.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM's Ability to Generate More Repository-Aware Unit Tests Through Precise Contextual Information Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07425v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though many learning-based approaches have been proposed for unit test generation and achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in relying on task-specific datasets. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt engineering have gained attention for their ability to handle a broad range of tasks, including unit test generation. Despite their success, LLMs may exhibit hallucinations when generating unit tests for focal methods or functions due to their lack of awareness regarding the project's global context. These hallucinations may manifest as calls to non-existent methods, as well as incorrect parameters or return values, such as mismatched parameter types or numbers. While many studies have explored the role of context, they often extract fixed patterns of context for different models and focal methods, which may not be suitable for all generation processes (e.g., excessive irrelevant context could lead to redundancy, preventing the model from focusing on essential information). To overcome this limitation, we propose RATester, which enhances the LLM's ability to generate more repository-aware unit tests through global contextual information injection. To equip LLMs with global knowledge similar to that of human testers, we integrate the language server gopls, which provides essential features (e.g., definition lookup) to assist the LLM. When RATester encounters an unfamiliar identifier (e.g., an unfamiliar struct name), it first leverages gopls to fetch relevant definitions and documentation comments, and then uses this global knowledge to guide the LLM. By utilizing gopls, RATester enriches the LLM's knowledge of the project's global context, thereby reducing hallucinations during unit test generation.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

Our evaluation consists of two experiments: (i) a human study in which 68 participants rated short stories from humans and the SLM on grammaticality, relevance, creativity, and attractiveness, and (ii) a qualitative linguistic analysis examining the textual characteristics of stories produced by each model. In the first experiment, BART-large outscored average human writers overall (2.11 vs. 1.85), a 14% relative improvement, though the slight human advantage in creativity was not statistically significant. In the second experiment, qualitative analysis showed that while GPT-4o demonstrated near-perfect coherence and used less cliche phrases, it tended to produce more predictable language, with only 3% of its synopses featuring surprising associations (compared to 15% for BART). These findings highlight how model size and fine-tuning influence the balance between creativity, fluency, and coherence in creative writing tasks, and demonstrate that smaller models can, in certain contexts, rival both humans and larger models.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Main Conference Paper at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Galapagos: Automated N-Version Programming with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09536v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>N-Version Programming is a well-known methodology for developing fault-tolerant systems. It achieves fault detection and correction at runtime by adding diverse redundancy into programs, minimizing fault mode overlap between redundant program variants. In this work, we propose the automated generation of program variants using large language models. We design, develop and evaluate Gal\'apagos: a tool for generating program variants using LLMs, validating their correctness and equivalence, and using them to assemble N-Version binaries. We evaluate Gal\'apagos by creating N-Version components of real-world C code. Our original results show that Gal\'apagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language. Our systematic diversity measurement indicates that functionally equivalent variants produced by Gal\'apagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime. We demonstrate that the variants produced by Gal\'apagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler. Overall, our paper shows that producing N-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical formal verification and generative language models.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

Traditional heuristic filters often miss low-quality text or mistakenly remove valuable content. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based line-level filtering method to enhance training data quality. We use GPT-4o mini to label a 20,000-document sample from FineWeb at the line level, allowing the model to create descriptive labels for low-quality lines. These labels are grouped into nine main categories, and we train a DeBERTa-v3 classifier to scale the filtering to a 10B-token subset of FineWeb. To test the impact of our filtering, we train GPT-2 models on both the original and the filtered datasets. The results show that models trained on the filtered data achieve higher accuracy on the HellaSwag benchmark and reach their performance targets faster, even with up to 25\% less data. This demonstrates that LLM-based line-level filtering can significantly improve data quality and training efficiency for LLMs. We release our quality-annotated dataset, FinerWeb-10BT, and the codebase to support further work in this area.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables.

This centralization, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality training data and mounting complexity of maintaining comprehensive expertise across rapidly expanding knowledge domains, poses critical challenges to the continued growth of LLMs. While solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offer potential remedies, maintaining up-to-date expert knowledge across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, particularly given the exponential growth of specialized information. This paper introduces LLMs Networks (LLM-Net), a blockchain-based framework that democratizes LLMs-as-a-Service through a decentralized network of specialized LLM providers. By leveraging collective computational resources and distributed domain expertise, LLM-Net incorporates fine-tuned expert models for various specific domains, ensuring sustained knowledge growth while maintaining service quality through collaborative prompting mechanisms. The framework's robust design includes blockchain technology for transparent transaction and performance validation, establishing an immutable record of service delivery. Our simulation, built on top of state-of-the-art LLMs such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, Grok-2, and GPT-4o, validates the effectiveness of the reputation-based mechanism in maintaining service quality by selecting high-performing respondents (LLM providers). Thereby it demonstrates the potential of LLM-Net to sustain AI advancement through the integration of decentralized expertise and blockchain-based accountability.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

However, existing methods for classifying author roles based on self-reports and clustering lack comprehensive contextual analysis of contributions. Thus, we present a transformative approach to classifying author roles in scientific teams using advanced large language models (LLMs), which offers a more refined analysis compared to traditional clustering methods. Specifically, we seek to complement and enhance these traditional methods by utilizing open source and proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama3 70B, Llama2 70B, and Mistral 7x8B, for role classification. Utilizing few-shot prompting, we categorize author roles and demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms other models across multiple categories, surpassing traditional approaches such as XGBoost and BERT. Our methodology also includes building a predictive deep learning model using 10 features. By training this model on a dataset derived from the OpenAlex database, which provides detailed metadata on academic publications -- such as author-publication history, author affiliation, research topics, and citation counts -- we achieve an F1 score of 0.76, demonstrating robust classification of author roles.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is a challenge even for modern NLP models. However, the abilities of large language models (LLMs) have not yet been tested on this task.

However, their vast number of parameters introduces significant memory challenges during training, particularly when using memory-intensive optimizers like Adam. Existing memory-efficient algorithms often rely on techniques such as singular value decomposition projection or weight freezing. While these approaches help alleviate memory constraints, they generally produce suboptimal results compared to full-rank updates. In this paper, we investigate the memory-efficient method beyond low-rank training, proposing a novel solution called Gradient Wavelet Transform (GWT), which applies wavelet transforms to gradients in order to significantly reduce the memory requirements for maintaining optimizer states. We demonstrate that GWT can be seamlessly integrated with memory-intensive optimizers, enabling efficient training without sacrificing performance. Through extensive experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we show that GWT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with advanced memory-efficient optimizers and full-rank approaches in terms of both memory usage and training performance.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

Previous research has demonstrated that a sparse representation of human touch can effectively convey social tactile signals. However, advances in human-robot tactile interaction remain limited, as many humanoid robots possess simplistic capabilities, such as only opening and closing their hands, restricting nuanced tactile expressions. In this study, we explore how a robot can use sparse representations of tactile vibrations to convey emotions to a person. To achieve this, we developed a wearable sleeve integrated with a 5x5 grid of vibration motors, enabling the robot to communicate diverse tactile emotions and gestures. Using chain prompts within a Large Language Model (LLM), we generated distinct 10-second vibration patterns corresponding to 10 emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, fear) and 6 touch gestures (e.g., pat, rub, tap). Participants (N = 32) then rated each vibration stimulus based on perceived valence and arousal. People are accurate at recognising intended emotions, a result which aligns with earlier findings. These results highlight the LLM's ability to generate emotional haptic data and effectively convey emotions through tactile signals. By translating complex emotional and tactile expressions into vibratory patterns, this research demonstrates how LLMs can enhance physical interaction between humans and robots.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for this task are usually designed to use scripting commands or visualized buttons for manipulation, especially for interactive automation functionalities, which have a steep learning curve and cumbersome user experience, making a notable barrier to designers' adoption. Aiming to address such a usability issue, this paper introduces LayoutCopilot, a pioneering multi-agent collaborative framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for interactive analog layout design. LayoutCopilot simplifies human-tool interaction by converting natural language instructions into executable script commands, and it interprets high-level design intents into actionable suggestions, significantly streamlining the design process. Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility, efficiency, and accessibility of LayoutCopilot in handling real-world analog designs.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 | 8pages, 8figures |
| **[An empirical study of LLaMA3 quantization: from LLMs to MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14047v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLaMA family, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters, has become one of the most powerful open-source large language models (LLMs) and the popular LLM backbone of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), widely used in computer vision and natural language understanding tasks. In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released and have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large scale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of low-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore LLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can potentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of LLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation issues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning (LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the low-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of low-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based LLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization methods. Our experimental results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers from non-negligible degradation in linguistic and visual contexts, particularly under ultra-low bit widths. This highlights the significant performance gap at low bit-width that needs to be addressed in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, driving LLMs and MLLMs to achieve higher accuracy at lower bit to enhance practicality. Our project is released on https://github.com/Macaronlin/LLaMA3-Quantization , and quantized models are released at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-ML .</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

In this work, we introduce the concept of critical tokens -- elements within reasoning trajectories that significantly influence incorrect outcomes. We present a novel framework for identifying these tokens through rollout sampling and demonstrate their substantial divergence from traditional error tokens. Through extensive experiments on datasets such as GSM8K and MATH500, we show that identifying and replacing critical tokens significantly improves model accuracy. We propose an efficient methodology for pinpointing these tokens in large-scale datasets using contrastive estimation and extend this framework to enhance model training processes with direct preference optimization (DPO). Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with the widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and Deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, cDPO. Our results underscore the potential of leveraging critical tokens to reduce errors in reasoning tasks, advancing the development of AI systems capable of robust logical deduction. Our code, annotated datasets, and trained models are available at https://github.com/chenzhiling9954/Critical-Tokens-Matter to support and encourage future research in this promising field.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 | Work in progress |

However, recent efforts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection remain preliminary, as they lack a deep understanding of whether a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability stems from the model itself or from external aids such as knowledge retrieval and tooling support. In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from other capabilities, such as vulnerability knowledge adoption, context information retrieval, and advanced prompt schemes. We introduce LLM4Vuln, a unified evaluation framework that separates and assesses LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities and examines improvements when combined with other enhancements. We conduct controlled experiments using 147 ground-truth vulnerabilities and 147 non-vulnerable cases in Solidity, Java and C/C++, testing them in a total of 3,528 scenarios across four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Phi-3, and Llama 3). Our findings reveal the varying impacts of knowledge enhancement, context supplementation, and prompt schemes.

However, there still lack evaluations of LLMs values that fulfill three desirable goals. (1) Value Clarification: We expect to clarify the underlying values of LLMs precisely and comprehensively, while current evaluations focus narrowly on safety risks such as bias and toxicity. (2) Evaluation Validity: Existing static, open-source benchmarks are prone to data contamination and quickly become obsolete as LLMs evolve. Additionally, these discriminative evaluations uncover LLMs' knowledge about values, rather than valid assessments of LLMs' behavioral conformity to values. (3) Value Pluralism: The pluralistic nature of human values across individuals and cultures is largely ignored in measuring LLMs value alignment. To address these challenges, we presents the Value Compass Leaderboard, with three correspondingly designed modules. It (i) grounds the evaluation on motivationally distinct \textit{basic values to clarify LLMs' underlying values from a holistic view; (ii) applies a \textit{generative evolving evaluation framework with adaptive test items for evolving LLMs and direct value recognition from behaviors in realistic scenarios; (iii) propose a metric that quantifies LLMs alignment with a specific value as a weighted sum over multiple dimensions, with weights determined by pluralistic values.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for addressing this time-consuming task. However, state-of-the-art LLM-based detection solutions are often plagued by high false-positive rates. In this paper, we push the boundaries of existing research in two key ways. First, our evaluation is based on Solidity v0.8, offering the most up-to-date insights compared to prior studies that focus on older versions (v0.4). Second, we leverage the latest five LLM models (across companies), ensuring comprehensive coverage across the most advanced capabilities in the field. We conducted a series of rigorous evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that a well-designed prompt can reduce the false-positive rate by over 60%. Surprisingly, we also discovered that the recall rate for detecting some specific vulnerabilities in Solidity v0.8 has dropped to just 13% compared to earlier versions (i.e., v0.4). Further analysis reveals the root cause of this decline: the reliance of LLMs on identifying changes in newly introduced libraries and frameworks during detection.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we are interested in using LLMs to update the RL policy in real time, with the goal of accelerating personalization. We use the text-based user preference to influence the action selection on the fly, in order to immediately incorporate the user preference. We use the term "user preference" as a broad term to refer to a user personal preference, constraint, health status, or a statement expressing like or dislike, etc. Our novel approach is a hybrid method that combines the LLM response and the RL action selection to improve the RL policy. Given an LLM prompt that incorporates the user preference, the LLM acts as a filter in the typical RL action selection. We investigate different prompting strategies and action selection strategies. To evaluate our approach, we implement a simulation environment that generates the text-based user preferences and models the constraints that impact behavioral dynamics. We show that our approach is able to take into account the text-based user preferences, while improving the RL policy, thus improving personalization in adaptive intervention.</p></details> | 2025-01-13 |  |

This ability enables LLMs to adopt the persona of individuals with specific backgrounds, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional, resource-intensive user studies. By mimicking human behavior, LLMs can anticipate responses based on concrete demographic or professional profiles. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in simulating individuals with diverse backgrounds and analyze the consistency of these simulated behaviors compared to real-world outcomes. In particular, we explore the potential of LLMs to interpret and respond to discharge summaries provided to patients leaving the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We evaluate and compare with human responses the comprehensibility of discharge summaries among individuals with varying educational backgrounds, using this analysis to assess the strengths and limitations of LLM-driven simulations. Notably, when LLMs are primed with educational background information, they deliver accurate and actionable medical guidance 88% of the time. However, when other information is provided, performance significantly drops, falling below random chance levels. This preliminary study shows the potential benefits and pitfalls of automatically generating patient-specific health information from diverse populations. While LLMs show promise in simulating health personas, our results highlight critical gaps that must be addressed before they can be reliably used in clinical settings. Our findings suggest that a straightforward query-response model could outperform a more tailored approach in delivering health information. This is a crucial first step in understanding how LLMs can be optimized for personalized health communication while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 |  |

However, it is challenging for users to discern whether the responses of LLM are generated with certainty or are fabricated to meet user expectations. In this paper, we introduce Uncertainty Tripartite Testing Paradigm (Unc-TTP), a novel method for classifying LLM uncertainty by leveraging output inconsistency. Specifically, Unc-TTP performs three rounds of sampling under varying label injection interference, enumerating all possible outcomes, and uses the degree of output inconsistency as the indicator of the LLM's intrinsic uncertainty. To validate the effectiveness of this inconsistency-defined uncertainty, we draw inspiration from Active Learning, comparing the informativeness of actively selected in-context examples. Our experiments show that uncertainty examples selected via Unc-TTP are more informative than certainty examples. Furthermore, the Unc-TTP-guided uncertainty-based active example selection strategy outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in classifying LLM uncertainty and enhancing in-context learning. This work not only underscores the potential of inconsistency-based uncertainty classification for both open- and closed-source LLMs but also presents a practical approach for leveraging uncertainty to improve LLM performance in real-world tasks.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 |  |

Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a na\"ive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025 (PPAI Workshop)</p></details> |

A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\times$ larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M to 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time Series Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

We address this issue by introducing a novel methodology that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to create synthetic cultural agents (SCAs) representing these populations. We subject these SCAs to classic behavioral experiments, including the dictator and ultimatum games. Our results demonstrate substantial cross-cultural variability in experimental behavior. Notably, for populations with available data, SCAs' behaviors qualitatively resemble those of real human subjects. For unstudied populations, our method can generate novel, testable hypotheses about economic behavior. By integrating AI into experimental economics, this approach offers an effective and ethical method to pilot experiments and refine protocols for hard-to-reach populations. Our study provides a new tool for cross-cultural economic studies and demonstrates how LLMs can help experimental behavioral research.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 |  |
| **[Leveraging Taxonomy and LLMs for Improved Multimodal Hierarchical Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06827v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-level Hierarchical Classification (MLHC) tackles the challenge of categorizing items within a complex, multi-layered class structure. However, traditional MLHC classifiers often rely on a backbone model with independent output layers, which tend to ignore the hierarchical relationships between classes. This oversight can lead to inconsistent predictions that violate the underlying taxonomy. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel taxonomy-embedded transitional LLM-agnostic framework for multimodality classification. The cornerstone of this advancement is the ability of models to enforce consistency across hierarchical levels. Our evaluations on the MEP-3M dataset - a multi-modal e-commerce product dataset with various hierarchical levels - demonstrated a significant performance improvement compared to conventional LLM structures.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, and accepted by COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging LLM and Text-Queried Separation for Noise-Robust Sound Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01174v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound Event Detection (SED) is challenging in noisy environments where overlapping sounds obscure target events. Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) aims to isolate the target sound events from a noisy clip. However, this approach can fail when the exact target sound is unknown, particularly in noisy test sets, leading to reduced performance. To address this issue, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to analyze and summarize acoustic data. By using LLMs to identify and select specific noise types, we implement a noise augmentation method for noise-robust fine-tuning. The fine-tuned model is applied to predict clip-wise event predictions as text queries for the LASS model. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves SED performance in noisy environments. This work represents an early application of LLMs in noise-robust SED and suggests a promising direction for handling overlapping events in SED. Codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/apple-yinhan/Noise-robust-SED.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Multi-Task Learning (Generalization) of LLMs via Detecting and Exploring Task-Specific Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06488v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior multi-task capabilities, understanding the learning mechanisms behind this is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we attempt to understand such mechanisms from the perspective of neurons. Specifically, we detect task-sensitive neurons in LLMs via gradient attribution on task-specific data. Through extensive deactivation and fine-tuning experiments, we demonstrate that the detected neurons are highly correlated with the given task, which we term as task-specific neurons. With these identified task-specific neurons, we delve into two common problems in multi-task learning and continuous learning: Generalization and Catastrophic Forgetting. We find that the overlap of task-specific neurons is strongly associated with generalization and specialization across tasks. Interestingly, at certain layers of LLMs, there is a high similarity in the parameters of different task-specific neurons, and such similarity is highly correlated with the generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose a neuron-level continuous fine-tuning method that only fine-tunes the current task-specific neurons during continuous learning, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our study provides insights into the interpretability of LLMs in multi-task learning.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 |  |
| **[Hierarchical Divide-and-Conquer for Fine-Grained Alignment in LLM-Based Medical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06741v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs) for medical applications, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of these models in clinical settings is paramount. Existing benchmarks often focus on fixed-format tasks like multiple-choice QA, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical diagnostics. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics and LLM-based evaluators struggle with misalignment, often providing oversimplified assessments that do not adequately reflect human judgment. To address these challenges, we introduce HDCEval, a Hierarchical Divide-and-Conquer Evaluation framework tailored for fine-grained alignment in medical evaluation. HDCEval is built on a set of fine-grained medical evaluation guidelines developed in collaboration with professional doctors, encompassing Patient Question Relevance, Medical Knowledge Correctness, and Expression. The framework decomposes complex evaluation tasks into specialized subtasks, each evaluated by expert models trained through Attribute-Driven Token Optimization (ADTO) on a meticulously curated preference dataset. This hierarchical approach ensures that each aspect of the evaluation is handled with expert precision, leading to a significant improvement in alignment with human evaluators.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 |  |

We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs' scientific creativity and divergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts. Drawing from Guilford's creativity theory, our framework employs a dynamic panel of state-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across four key dimensions: originality, feasibility, fluency, and flexibility. Through extensive experimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18 scientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct patterns from general intelligence metrics. Notably, our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to top-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores. These findings highlight the importance of specialized evaluation frameworks for scientific creativity and suggest that the development of creative capabilities in LLMs may follow different trajectories than traditional problem-solving abilities.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated author list, Corrected some issues and ref</p></details> |

These games rely heavily on conversation-driven interactions and require agents to infer, make decisions, and express based on such information. While this progress leads to more sophisticated and strategic non-player characters (NPCs) in SDGs, there exists a need to control the proficiency of these agents. This control not only ensures that NPCs can adapt to varying difficulty levels during gameplay, but also provides insights into the safety and fairness of LLM agents. In this paper, we present DVM, a novel framework for developing controllable LLM agents for SDGs, and demonstrate its implementation on one of the most popular SDGs, Werewolf. DVM comprises three main components: Predictor, Decider, and Discussor. By integrating reinforcement learning with a win rate-constrained decision chain reward mechanism, we enable agents to dynamically adjust their gameplay proficiency to achieve specified win rates. Experiments show that DVM not only outperforms existing methods in the Werewolf game, but also successfully modulates its performance levels to meet predefined win rate targets. These results pave the way for LLM agents' adaptive and balanced gameplay in SDGs, opening new avenues for research in controllable game agents.</p></details> | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Equity training requires a nuanced understanding of context, but do contemporary large language models (LLMs) have a knowledge base that can navigate these nuances? Legacy transformer models like BERT, in contrast, have less real-world knowledge but can be more easily fine-tuned than commercial LLMs. Here, we study whether fine-tuning BERT on human annotations outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo) with few-shot prompting and instruction. We evaluate performance on four prediction tasks involving generating and explaining open-ended responses in advocacy-focused training lessons in a higher education student population learning to become middle school tutors. Leveraging a dataset of 243 human-annotated open responses from tutor training lessons, we find that BERT demonstrates superior performance using an offline fine-tuning approach, which is more resource-efficient than commercial GPT models. We conclude that contemporary GPT models may not adequately capture nuanced response patterns, especially in complex tasks requiring explanation. This work advances the understanding of AI-driven learner evaluation under the lens of fine-tuning versus few-shot prompting on the nuanced task of equity training, contributing to more effective training solutions and assisting practitioners in choosing adequate assessment methods.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Page Workshop Paper, AAAI2025 Workshop on Innovation and Responsibility in AI-Supported Education (iRAISE) - Open-response Grading, Feedback, Equity Training, LLMs, BERT, GPT-4</p></details> |

We demonstrate the importance of interestingness measure using a quantitative analysis, by highlighting its impact on the overall performance of our proposed system, particularly in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Using the Wikidata Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data (WCH-LOD) dataset, our approach yields a precision of 0.70, recall of 0.68, and an F1-score of 0.69, representing an improvement compared to graph-based (precision: 0.28, recall: 0.25, F1-score: 0.26) and knowledge-based baselines (precision: 0.45, recall: 0.42, F1-score: 0.43). Furthermore, our LLM-powered explanations exhibit better quality, reflected in BLEU (0.52), ROUGE-L (0.58), and METEOR (0.63) scores, all higher than the baseline approaches. We show a strong correlation (0.65) between interestingness measure and the quality of generated explanations, validating its effectiveness. The findings highlight the importance of LLMs and a mathematical formalization for interestingness in enhancing the effectiveness of relational exploration in cultural heritage knowledge graphs, with results that are measurable and testable. We further show that the system enables more effective exploration compared to purely knowledge-based and graph-based methods.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 |  |
| **[Guided Code Generation with LLMs: A Multi-Agent Framework for Complex Code Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06625v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks, yet they face significant limitations in handling complex, long-context programming challenges and demonstrating complex compositional reasoning abilities. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework for ``guided code generation'' that tries to address these limitations through a deliberately structured, fine-grained approach to code generation tasks. Our framework leverages LLMs' strengths as fuzzy searchers and approximate information retrievers while mitigating their weaknesses in long sequential reasoning and long-context understanding. Empirical evaluation using OpenAI's HumanEval benchmark with Meta's Llama 3.1 8B model (int4 precision) demonstrates a 23.79\% improvement in solution accuracy compared to direct one-shot generation. Our results indicate that structured, guided approaches to code generation can significantly enhance the practical utility of LLMs in software development while overcoming their inherent limitations in compositional reasoning and context handling.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 | 4 pages, 3 figures |

Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used and effective for fine-tuning, we have observed that its scaling factor can limit or even reduce performance as the rank size increases. To address this issue, we propose RoRA (Rank-adaptive Reliability Optimization), a simple yet effective method for optimizing LoRA's scaling factor. By replacing $\alpha/r$ with $\alpha/\sqrt{r}$, RoRA ensures improved performance as rank size increases. Moreover, RoRA enhances low-rank adaptation in fine-tuning uncompressed models and excels in the more challenging task of accuracy recovery when fine-tuning pruned models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RoRA in fine-tuning both uncompressed and pruned models. RoRA surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in average accuracy and robustness on LLaMA-7B/13B, LLaMA2-7B, and LLaMA3-8B, specifically outperforming LoRA and DoRA by 6.5% and 2.9% on LLaMA-7B, respectively. In pruned model fine-tuning, RoRA shows significant advantages; for SHEARED-LLAMA-1.3, a LLaMA-7B with 81.4% pruning, RoRA achieves 5.7% higher average accuracy than LoRA and 3.9% higher than DoRA.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)</p></details> |

We introduce EmoXpt, a sentiment analysis framework designed to assess both human perspectives on generative AI and the sentiment embedded in ChatGPT's responses. Unlike prior studies that focus exclusively on human sentiment, EmoXpt uniquely evaluates the emotional expression of ChatGPT. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-generated responses are notably more efficient, cohesive, and consistently positive than human responses.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables.

While recent studies have yielded valuable insights into the mechanisms of textual LLMs, the mechanisms of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remain underexplored. In this paper, we apply mechanistic interpretability methods to analyze the visual question answering (VQA) mechanisms in the first MLLM, Llava. We compare the mechanisms between VQA and textual QA (TQA) in color answering tasks and find that: a) VQA exhibits a mechanism similar to the in-context learning mechanism observed in TQA; b) the visual features exhibit significant interpretability when projecting the visual embeddings into the embedding space; and c) Llava enhances the existing capabilities of the corresponding textual LLM Vicuna during visual instruction tuning. Based on these findings, we develop an interpretability tool to help users and researchers identify important visual locations for final predictions, aiding in the understanding of visual hallucination. Our method demonstrates faster and more effective results compared to existing interpretability approaches.

In this work, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. Specifically, we design three orthogonal approaches and hybrids of those to leverage the power of LLMs in different ways. In addition, we investigate the potential of each approach by focusing on its comprising technical aspects and determining an array of alternative choices for each one. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and explore a large variety of configurations, including different language models and baseline recommendation models, to obtain a comprehensive picture of the performance of each approach. Among other observations, we highlight that initializing state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models such as BERT4Rec or SASRec with embeddings obtained from an LLM can lead to substantial performance gains in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we find that fine-tuning an LLM for recommendation tasks enables it to learn not only the tasks, but also concepts of a domain to some extent. We also show that fine-tuning OpenAI GPT leads to considerably better performance than fine-tuning Google PaLM 2. Overall, our extensive experiments indicate a huge potential value of leveraging LLMs in future recommendation approaches. We publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

To address these challenges, this paper proposes three core technical solutions: LLM sharing protocol, LLM universal environment framework, and Agent optimal path module. To solve the computational resource constraints in the early stages of research, we further innovatively propose a joint mining mechanism, achieving bilateral value sharing between computing power providers and model designers, including breakthrough rewards for optimal model paths and long-term profit distribution, thereby providing researchers with cost-optimized computational resource support and promoting the continuous development of LLM research and applications.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM Agents for Code Generation with Possibility and Pass-rate Prioritized Experience Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12236v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays transformer-based Large Language Models (LLM) for code generation tasks usually apply sampling and filtering pipelines. Due to the sparse reward problem in code generation tasks caused by one-token incorrectness, transformer-based models will sample redundant programs till they find a correct one, leading to low efficiency. To overcome the challenge, we incorporate Experience Replay (ER) in the fine-tuning phase, where codes and programs produced are stored and will be replayed to give the LLM agent a chance to learn from past experiences. Based on the spirit of ER, we introduce a novel approach called BTP pipeline which consists of three phases: beam search sampling, testing phase, and prioritized experience replay phase. The approach makes use of failed programs collected by code models and replays programs with high Possibility and Pass-rate Prioritized value (P2Value) from the replay buffer to improve efficiency. P2Value comprehensively considers the possibility of transformers' output and pass rate and can make use of the redundant resources caused by the problem that most programs collected by LLMs fail to pass any tests. We empirically apply our approach in several LLMs, demonstrating that it enhances their performance in code generation tasks and surpasses existing baselines.</p></details> | 2025-01-11 |  |

Attention in transformer-based methods requires something worth attending to -- more than just samples of a time-series. We explore different methods to map multivariate input time series into the LLM token embedding space. In particular, our novel multivariate patching strategy to embed time series features into decoder-only pre-trained Transformers produces results competitive with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.

We propose a probabilistic framework for systematically analyzing and improving these systems by modeling and refining distributions over clusters of semantically equivalent outputs. This framework facilitates the evaluation and iterative improvement of Transference Models -- key software components that utilize LLMs to transform inputs into outputs for downstream tasks. To illustrate its utility, we apply the framework to the autoformalization problem, where natural language documentation is transformed into formal program specifications. Our case illustrates how probabilistic analysis enables the identification of weaknesses and guides focused alignment improvements, resulting in more reliable and interpretable outputs. This principled approach offers a foundation for addressing critical challenges in the development of robust LLM-enabled systems.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 |  |

These LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) enable groups of intelligent agents to coordinate and solve complex tasks collectively at scale, transitioning from isolated models to collaboration-centric approaches. This work provides an extensive survey of the collaborative aspect of MASs and introduces an extensible framework to guide future research. Our framework characterizes collaboration mechanisms based on key dimensions: actors (agents involved), types (e.g., cooperation, competition, or coopetition), structures (e.g., peer-to-peer, centralized, or distributed), strategies (e.g., role-based or model-based), and coordination protocols. Through a review of existing methodologies, our findings serve as a foundation for demystifying and advancing LLM-based MASs toward more intelligent and collaborative solutions for complex, real-world use cases. In addition, various applications of MASs across diverse domains, including 5G/6G networks, Industry 5.0, question answering, and social and cultural settings, are also investigated, demonstrating their wider adoption and broader impacts. Finally, we identify key lessons learned, open challenges, and potential research directions of MASs towards artificial collective intelligence.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 |  |
| **[FlatQuant: Flatness Matters for LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09426v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models~(LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with the equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still remain steep and outspread. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach to enhance flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations tailored to each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead, we apply Kronecker decomposition to the transformation matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments show that FlatQuant sets up a new state-of-the-art quantization benchmark. For instance, it achieves less than $\textbf{1}\%$ accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by $\textbf{7.5}\%$. For inference latency, FlatQuant reduces the slowdown induced by pre-quantization transformation from 0.26x of QuaRot to merely $\textbf{0.07x}$, bringing up to $\textbf{2.3x}$ speedup for prefill and $\textbf{1.7x}$ speedup for decoding, respectively.

Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving. To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and code are publicly available.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | 15 pages, 5 Figures |

Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC>60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC>60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 |  |

Most existing solutions address this challenge by focusing on aligning the models with credible sources or by improving how models communicate their confidence (or lack thereof) in their outputs. While these measures may be effective in most contexts, they may fall short in scenarios requiring more nuanced approaches, especially in situations where access to accurate data is limited or determining credible sources is challenging. In this study, we take North Korea - a country characterised by an extreme lack of reliable sources and the prevalence of sensationalist falsehoods - as a case study. We explore and evaluate how some of the best-performing multilingual LLMs and specific language-based models generate information about North Korea in three languages spoken in countries with significant geo-political interests: English (United States, United Kingdom), Korean (South Korea), and Mandarin Chinese (China). Our findings reveal significant differences, suggesting that the choice of model and language can lead to vastly different understandings of North Korea, which has important implications given the global security challenges the country poses.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model Inversion in Split Learning for Personalized LLMs: New Insights from Information Bottleneck Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05965v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent, showcasing the impressive capabilities of models like GPT-4. This trend has also catalyzed extensive research on deploying LLMs on mobile devices. Feasible approaches for such edge-cloud deployment include using split learning. However, previous research has largely overlooked the privacy leakage associated with intermediate representations transmitted from devices to servers. This work is the first to identify model inversion attacks in the split learning framework for LLMs, emphasizing the necessity of secure defense. For the first time, we introduce mutual information entropy to understand the information propagation of Transformer-based LLMs and assess privacy attack performance for LLM blocks. To address the issue of representations being sparser and containing less information than embeddings, we propose a two-stage attack system in which the first part projects representations into the embedding space, and the second part uses a generative model to recover text from these embeddings. This design breaks down the complexity and achieves attack scores of 38%-75% in various scenarios, with an over 60% improvement over the SOTA. This work comprehensively highlights the potential privacy risks during the deployment of personalized LLMs on the edge side.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | 8 pages |

A Preliminary Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11629v5)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators to assess the performance of LLMs has garnered attention. However, this kind of evaluation approach is affected by potential biases within LLMs, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and study two many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt templates to help LLM evaluators mitigate potential biases: Many-Shot with Reference (MSwR) and Many-Shot without Reference (MSoR). Specifically, the former utilizes in-context examples with model-generated evaluation rationales as references, while the latter does not include these references. Using these prompt designs, we investigate the impact of increasing the number of in-context examples on the consistency and quality of the evaluation results. Experimental results show that advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Furthermore, when using GPT-4o as an evaluator in the many-shot regime, adopting MSwR as the prompt template performs better than MSoR.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLMs Reproduce Stereotypes of Sexual and Gender Minorities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05926v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large body of research has found substantial gender bias in NLP systems. Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used psychological framework -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from LLMs, just as they do from humans. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, raising concerns about their capacity to amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely promoted use case.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We study the affordability of these models for educators and students by investigating how LLMs answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with respect to hardware constraints and refinement techniques. We explore this space by using generic pre-trained LLMs (the 7B, 13B, and 70B variants of LLaMA-2) to answer 162 undergraduate-level MCQs from a course on Programming Languages (PL) -- the MCQ dataset is a contribution of this work, which we make publicly available. Specifically, we dissect how different factors, such as using readily-available material -- (parts of) the course's textbook -- for fine-tuning and quantisation (to decrease resource usage) can change the accuracy of the responses. The main takeaway is that smaller textbook-based fine-tuned models outperform generic larger ones (whose pre-training requires conspicuous resources), making the usage of LLMs for answering MCQs resource- and material-wise affordable.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 40th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing</p></details> |
| **[I Can't Share Code, but I need Translation -- An Empirical Study on Code Translation through Federated LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05724v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to the rapid evolution of technologies and project requirements, organizations need to upgrade the code base in their software projects to a new version of the programming language or even translating to an entirely new one. However, code translation is resource-intensive and requires expertise in both the source and target languages. While researchers have made progress in automating translations between legacy and modern languages, recent work has increasingly turned to pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate efficiently. Given the proprietary nature of code, organizations prefer fine-tuning LLMs locally rather than relying on external APIs. This is one of the first empirical studies that proposes a Federated LLM-based approach for code translation. The proposed approach enables clients to jointly train a code translator without sharing sensitive data. This study demonstrates that participants can collaboratively develop a FedLLM for efficient code translation (particularly C\# to Java and vice-versa) with superior results (more than 40\% improvement in CodeLLaMA's CodeBLEU score) compared to individual client models. Our findings indicate that FedLLM offers a collaborative approach to code translation and could serve as a promising direction for future research in this field.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | 10 pages |
| **[Debugging Without Error Messages: How LLM Prompting Strategy Affects Programming Error Explanation Effectiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05706v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making errors is part of the programming process -- even for the most seasoned professionals. Novices in particular are bound to make many errors while learning. It is well known that traditional (compiler/interpreter) programming error messages have been less than helpful for many novices and can have effects such as being frustrating, containing confusing jargon, and being downright misleading. Recent work has found that large language models (LLMs) can generate excellent error explanations, but that the effectiveness of these error messages heavily depends on whether the LLM has been provided with context -- typically the original source code where the problem occurred. Knowing that programming error messages can be misleading and/or contain that serves little-to-no use (particularly for novices) we explore the reverse: what happens when GPT-3.5 is prompted for error explanations on just the erroneous source code itself -- original compiler/interpreter produced error message excluded. We utilized various strategies to make more effective error explanations, including one-shot prompting and fine-tuning. We report the baseline results of how effective the error explanations are at providing feedback, as well as how various prompting strategies might improve the explanations' effectiveness. Our results can help educators by understanding how LLMs respond to such prompts that novices are bound to make, and hopefully lead to more effective use of Generative AI in the classroom.</p></details> | 2025-01-10 | 7 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Active Inference for Self-Organizing Multi-LLM Systems: A Bayesian Thermodynamic Approach to Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10425v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 |  |

In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model, incorporating architectural designs, training procedures, and curated datasets to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last <EOS> token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For training algorithm, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. For training data, we utilize the hard-negative mining, synthetic data generation and existing public available datasets to boost the performance of embedding model. By combining these techniques, our NV-Embed-v1 and NV-Embed-v2 models obtained the No.1 position on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024 and August 30, 2024, respectively) across 56 embedding tasks, demonstrating the sustained effectiveness of the proposed methods over time. Additionally, it achieved the highest scores in the Long Doc section and the second-highest scores in the QA section of the AIR Benchmark, which covers a range of out-of-domain information retrieval topics beyond those in MTEB.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>We op...</summary><p>We open-source the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Embed-v2</p></details> |

However, the desire to deploy LLMs on edge devices introduces energy efficiency and latency challenges. Recurrent LLM (R-LLM) architectures have proven effective in mitigating the quadratic complexity of self-attention, making them a potential paradigm for computing on-edge neuromorphic processors. In this work, we propose a low-cost, training-free algorithm to sparsify R-LLMs' activations to enhance energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent structure of these models, rendering them well-suited for energy-constrained environments. Although primarily designed for R-LLMs, this method can be generalized to other LLM architectures, such as transformers, as demonstrated on the OPT model, achieving comparable sparsity and efficiency improvements. Empirical studies illustrate that our method significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining competitive accuracy across multiple zero-shot learning benchmarks. Additionally, hardware simulations with the SENECA neuromorphic processor underscore notable energy savings and latency improvements. These results pave the way for low-power, real-time neuromorphic deployment of LLMs and demonstrate the feasibility of training-free on-chip adaptation using activation sparsity.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AICAS 2025</p></details> |
| **[OVO-Bench: How Far is Your Video-LLMs from Real-World Online Video Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05510v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Awareness, the ability to reason dynamically based on the timestamp when a question is raised, is the key distinction between offline and online video LLMs. Unlike offline models, which rely on complete videos for static, post hoc analysis, online models process video streams incrementally and dynamically adapt their responses based on the timestamp at which the question is posed. Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional benchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning.

Addressing the imperative need for proper authorship attribution is essential to uphold the credibility and accountability of authentic authorship. The rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have blurred the lines between human and machine authorship, posing significant challenges for traditional methods. We presents a comprehensive literature review that examines the latest research on authorship attribution in the era of LLMs. This survey systematically explores the landscape of this field by categorizing four representative problems: (1) Human-written Text Attribution; (2) LLM-generated Text Detection; (3) LLM-generated Text Attribution; and (4) Human-LLM Co-authored Text Attribution. We also discuss the challenges related to ensuring the generalization and explainability of authorship attribution methods. Generalization requires the ability to generalize across various domains, while explainability emphasizes providing transparent and understandable insights into the decisions made by these models. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of existing methods and benchmarks, we identify key open problems and future research directions in this field. This literature review serves a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field.

However, research on bias in code generation remains limited. Existing studies typically assess bias by applying malicious prompts or reapply tasks and dataset for discriminative models. Given that LLMs are often aligned with human values and that prior datasets are not fully optimized for code-related tasks, there is a pressing need for benchmarks specifically designed for evaluating code models. In this study, we introduce FairCode, a novel benchmark for evaluating bias in code generation. FairCode comprises two tasks: function implementation and test case generation, each evaluating social bias through diverse scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new metric, FairScore, to assess model performance on this benchmark. We conduct experiments on widely used LLMs and provide a comprehensive analysis of the results. The findings reveal that all tested LLMs exhibit bias. The code is available at https://github.com/YongkDu/FairCode.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 |  |

As a result, they struggle with memorizing rare events and with updating their memory as facts change over time. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memory makes it challenging to prevent hallucination. Model editing and augmenting LLMs with parameters specialized for memory are only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM's capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM's performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 |  |
| **[Codebook LLMs: Evaluating LLMs as Measurement Tools for Political Science Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10747v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Codebooks -- documents that operationalize concepts and outline annotation procedures -- are used almost universally by social scientists when coding political texts. To code these texts automatically, researchers are increasing turning to generative large language models (LLMs). However, there is limited empirical evidence on whether "off-the-shelf" LLMs faithfully follow real-world codebook operationalizations and measure complex political constructs with sufficient accuracy. To address this, we gather and curate three real-world political science codebooks -- covering protest events, political violence and manifestos -- along with their unstructured texts and human labels. We also propose a five-stage framework for codebook-LLM measurement: preparing a codebook for both humans and LLMs, testing LLMs' basic capabilities on a codebook, evaluating zero-shot measurement accuracy (i.e. off-the-shelf performance), analyzing errors, and further (parameter-efficient) supervised training of LLMs. We provide an empirical demonstration of this framework using our three codebook datasets and several pretrained 7-12 billion open-weight LLMs. We find current open-weight LLMs have limitations in following codebooks zero-shot, but that supervised instruction tuning can substantially improve performance. Rather than suggesting the "best" LLM, our contribution lies in our codebook datasets, evaluation framework, and guidance for applied researchers who wish to implement their own codebook-LLM measurement projects.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2 (v1 Presented at PolMeth 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Safeguarding System Prompts for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13426v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in applications where system prompts, which guide model outputs, play a crucial role. These prompts often contain business logic and sensitive information, making their protection essential. However, adversarial and even regular user queries can exploit LLM vulnerabilities to expose these hidden prompts. To address this issue, we propose PromptKeeper, a robust defense mechanism designed to safeguard system prompts. PromptKeeper tackles two core challenges: reliably detecting prompt leakage and mitigating side-channel vulnerabilities when leakage occurs. By framing detection as a hypothesis-testing problem, PromptKeeper effectively identifies both explicit and subtle leakage. Upon detection, it regenerates responses using a dummy prompt, ensuring that outputs remain indistinguishable from typical interactions when no leakage is present. PromptKeeper ensures robust protection against prompt extraction attacks via either adversarial or regular queries, while preserving conversational capability and runtime efficiency during benign user interactions.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their broader adoption is limited by significant computational demands and high resource requirements, particularly memory and processing power. To mitigate such requirements, model pruning techniques are used to create more compact models with significantly fewer parameters. However, current approaches do not focus on the efficient extraction of programming-language-specific sub-models. In this work, we explore the idea of efficiently deriving coding-specific sub-models through unstructured pruning (i.e., Wanda). We investigate the impact of different domain-specific calibration datasets on pruning outcomes across three distinct domains and extend our analysis to extracting four language-specific sub-models: Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. We are the first to efficiently extract programming-language-specific sub-models using appropriate calibration datasets while maintaining acceptable accuracy w.r.t. full models. We are also the first to provide analytical evidence that domain-specific tasks activate distinct regions within LLMs, supporting the creation of specialized sub-models through unstructured pruning. We believe that this work has significant potential to enhance LLM accessibility for coding by reducing computational requirements to enable local execution on consumer-grade hardware, and supporting faster inference times critical for real-time development feedback.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 |  |

We fine-tune the Whisper model on human-generated Estonian subtitles and enhance it with iterative pseudo-labeling and large language model (LLM) based post-editing. Our experiments demonstrate notable subtitle quality improvement through pseudo-labeling with an unlabeled dataset. We find that applying LLM-based editing at test time enhances subtitle accuracy, while its use during training does not yield further gains. This approach holds promise for creating subtitle quality close to human standard and could be extended to real-time applications.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 |  |
| **[Latent Reward: LLM-Empowered Credit Assignment in Episodic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11120v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) often encounters delayed and sparse feedback in real-world applications, even with only episodic rewards. Previous approaches have made some progress in reward redistribution for credit assignment but still face challenges, including training difficulties due to redundancy and ambiguous attributions stemming from overlooking the multifaceted nature of mission performance evaluation. Hopefully, Large Language Model (LLM) encompasses fruitful decision-making knowledge and provides a plausible tool for reward redistribution. Even so, deploying LLM in this case is non-trivial due to the misalignment between linguistic knowledge and the symbolic form requirement, together with inherent randomness and hallucinations in inference. To tackle these issues, we introduce LaRe, a novel LLM-empowered symbolic-based decision-making framework, to improve credit assignment. Key to LaRe is the concept of the Latent Reward, which works as a multi-dimensional performance evaluation, enabling more interpretable goal attainment from various perspectives and facilitating more effective reward redistribution. We examine that semantically generated code from LLM can bridge linguistic knowledge and symbolic latent rewards, as it is executable for symbolic objects. Meanwhile, we design latent reward self-verification to increase the stability and reliability of LLM inference. Theoretically, reward-irrelevant redundancy elimination in the latent reward benefits RL performance from more accurate reward estimation. Extensive experimental results witness that LaRe (i) achieves superior temporal credit assignment to SOTA methods, (ii) excels in allocating contributions among multiple agents, and (iii) outperforms policies trained with ground truth rewards for certain tasks.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 |  |

One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source LLM designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight LLM model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other LLM model to generate patches for the identified files. Then, to mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches, and train the two modules of SWE-Fixer separately. We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with scores of 23.3% and 30.2%, respectively. These outcomes highlight the efficacy of our approach.

In this paper, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs), both open-source and commercial, for SMS spam detection, comparing their performance across zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting approaches. Using a comprehensive dataset of SMS messages, we assess the spam detection capabilities of prominent LLMs such as GPT-4, DeepSeek, LLAMA-2, and Mixtral. Our findings reveal that while zero-shot learning provides convenience, it is unreliable for effective spam detection. Few-shot learning, particularly with carefully selected examples, improves detection but exhibits variability across models. Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective strategy, with Mixtral achieving 98.6% accuracy and a balanced false positive and false negative rate below 2%, meeting the criteria for robust spam detection. Furthermore, we explore the resilience of these models to adversarial attacks, finding that fine-tuning significantly enhances robustness against both perceptible and imperceptible manipulations. Lastly, we investigate the impact of concept drift and demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, especially when combined with few-shot learning, can mitigate its effects, maintaining high performance even on evolving spam datasets. This study highlights the importance of fine-tuning and tailored learning strategies to deploy LLMs effectively for real-world SMS spam detection</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | 17 pages |

This paper addresses this problem by exploring strategies to integrate multiple domain-specialized models into an efficient pivot model.We propose two fusion strategies to combine the strengths of multiple LLMs: (1) a pairwise, multi-step fusion approach that sequentially distills each source model into the pivot model, followed by a weight merging step to integrate the distilled models into the final model. This method achieves strong performance but requires substantial training effort; and (2) a unified fusion approach that aggregates all source models' outputs simultaneously.To improve the fusion process, we introduce a novel Rate-Skewness Adaptive Fusion (RSAF) technique, which dynamically adjusts top-K ratios during parameter merging for enhanced flexibility and stability.Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-based weighting method for the unified approach, which dynamically balances the contributions of source models and outperforms other logits/distribution ensemble methods.We achieved accuracy improvements of 9.27%, 8.80%, and 8.89% on the GSM8K, MATH, and HumanEval tasks, respectively.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | Under review |

However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach begins by identifying the core capabilities required for the target domain and designing a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with these needs. We then analyze the effectiveness of key post-training stages, including continual pretraining, instruction tuning, and preference alignment. Building on these insights, we propose an effective training recipe centered on a novel preference data distillation method, which leverages process signals from a generative reward model. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks.

Replicating Crowdsourcing Pipelines with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10168v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have shown promise in replicating human-like behavior in crowdsourcing tasks that were previously thought to be exclusive to human abilities. However, current efforts focus mainly on simple atomic tasks. We explore whether LLMs can replicate more complex crowdsourcing pipelines. We find that modern LLMs can simulate some of crowdworkers' abilities in these ``human computation algorithms,'' but the level of success is variable and influenced by requesters' understanding of LLM capabilities, the specific skills required for sub-tasks, and the optimal interaction modality for performing these sub-tasks. We reflect on human and LLMs' different sensitivities to instructions, stress the importance of enabling human-facing safeguards for LLMs, and discuss the potential of training humans and LLMs with complementary skill sets. Crucially, we show that replicating crowdsourcing pipelines offers a valuable platform to investigate 1) the relative LLM strengths on different tasks (by cross-comparing their performances on sub-tasks) and 2) LLMs' potential in complex tasks, where they can complete part of the tasks while leaving others to humans.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 |  |
| **[A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected typos & more discussion on reasoning models 33 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.05470 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing the Power of LLM to Support Binary Taint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08275v4)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes LATTE, the first static binary taint analysis that is powered by a large language model (LLM). LATTE is superior to the state of the art (e.g., Emtaint, Arbiter, Karonte) in three aspects. First, LATTE is fully automated while prior static binary taint analyzers need rely on human expertise to manually customize taint propagation rules and vulnerability inspection rules. Second, LATTE is significantly effective in vulnerability detection, demonstrated by our comprehensive evaluations. For example, LATTE has found 37 new bugs in real-world firmware which the baselines failed to find, and 7 of them have been assigned CVE numbers. Lastly, LATTE incurs remarkably low engineering cost, making it a cost-efficient and scalable solution for security researchers and practitioners. We strongly believe that LATTE opens up a new direction to harness the recent advance in LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis for binary programs.</p></details> | 2025-01-09 | 36 pages,16 figures |
