| **[Scaffold-GS: Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00109v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural rendering methods have significantly advanced photo-realistic 3D scene rendering in various academic and industrial applications. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting method has achieved the state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed combining the benefits of both primitive-based representations and volumetric representations. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians that try to fit every training view, neglecting the underlying scene geometry. Consequently, the resulting model becomes less robust to significant view changes, texture-less area and lighting effects. We introduce Scaffold-GS, which uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians, and predicts their attributes on-the-fly based on viewing direction and distance within the view frustum. Anchor growing and pruning strategies are developed based on the importance of neural Gaussians to reliably improve the scene coverage. We show that our method effectively reduces redundant Gaussians while delivering high-quality rendering. We also demonstrates an enhanced capability to accommodate scenes with varying levels-of-detail and view-dependent observations, without sacrificing the rendering speed.</p></details> | 2023-11-30 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://city-super.github.io/scaffold-gs/</p></details> |
| **[Control4D: Efficient 4D Portrait Editing with Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20082v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Control4D, an innovative framework for editing dynamic 4D portraits using text instructions. Our method addresses the prevalent challenges in 4D editing, notably the inefficiencies of existing 4D representations and the inconsistent editing effect caused by diffusion-based editors. We first propose GaussianPlanes, a novel 4D representation that makes Gaussian Splatting more structured by applying plane-based decomposition in 3D space and time. This enhances both efficiency and robustness in 4D editing. Furthermore, we propose to leverage a 4D generator to learn a more continuous generation space from inconsistent edited images produced by the diffusion-based editor, which effectively improves the consistency and quality of 4D editing. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of Control4D, including significantly reduced training time, high-quality rendering, and spatial-temporal consistency in 4D portrait editing.

| **[HUGS: Human Gaussian Splats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17910v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural rendering have improved both training and rendering times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work, we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g. cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model. Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene. We achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality with a rendering speed of 60 FPS while being ~100x faster to train over previous work. Our code will be announced here: https://github.com/apple/ml-hugs</p></details> | 2023-11-29 |  |
| **[CG3D: Compositional Generation for Text-to-3D via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17907v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the onset of diffusion-based generative models and their ability to generate text-conditioned images, content generation has received a massive invigoration. Recently, these models have been shown to provide useful guidance for the generation of 3D graphics assets. However, existing work in text-conditioned 3D generation faces fundamental constraints: (i) inability to generate detailed, multi-object scenes, (ii) inability to textually control multi-object configurations, and (iii) physically realistic scene composition. In this work, we propose CG3D, a method for compositionally generating scalable 3D assets that resolves these constraints. We find that explicit Gaussian radiance fields, parameterized to allow for compositions of objects, possess the capability to enable semantically and physically consistent scenes. By utilizing a guidance framework built around this explicit representation, we show state of the art results, capable of even exceeding the guiding diffusion model in terms of object combinations and physics accuracy.</p></details> | 2023-11-29 |  |
| **[GaussianShader: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Shading Functions for Reflective Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17977v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of neural 3D Gaussians has recently brought about a revolution in the field of neural rendering, facilitating the generation of high-quality renderings at real-time speeds. However, the explicit and discrete representation encounters challenges when applied to scenes featuring reflective surfaces. In this paper, we present GaussianShader, a novel method that applies a simplified shading function on 3D Gaussians to enhance the neural rendering in scenes with reflective surfaces while preserving the training and rendering efficiency. The main challenge in applying the shading function lies in the accurate normal estimation on discrete 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we proposed a novel normal estimation framework based on the shortest axis directions of 3D Gaussians with a delicately designed loss to make the consistency between the normals and the geometries of Gaussian spheres. Experiments show that GaussianShader strikes a commendable balance between efficiency and visual quality. Our method surpasses Gaussian Splatting in PSNR on specular object datasets, exhibiting an improvement of 1.57dB. When compared to prior works handling reflective surfaces, such as Ref-NeRF, our optimization time is significantly accelerated (23h vs. 0.58h).

| **[Point'n Move: Interactive Scene Object Manipulation on Gaussian Splatting Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16737v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Point'n Move, a method that achieves interactive scene object manipulation with exposed region inpainting. Interactivity here further comes from intuitive object selection and real-time editing. To achieve this, we adopt Gaussian Splatting Radiance Field as the scene representation and fully leverage its explicit nature and speed advantage. Its explicit representation formulation allows us to devise a 2D prompt points to 3D mask dual-stage self-prompting segmentation algorithm, perform mask refinement and merging, minimize change as well as provide good initialization for scene inpainting and perform editing in real-time without per-editing training, all leads to superior quality and performance. We test our method by performing editing on both forward-facing and 360 scenes. We also compare our method against existing scene object removal methods, showing superior quality despite being more capable and having a speed advantage.</p></details> | 2023-11-28 |  |
| **[Mip-Splatting: Alias-free 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16493v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, reaching high fidelity and efficiency. However, strong artifacts can be observed when changing the sampling rate, \eg, by changing focal length or camera distance. We find that the source for this phenomenon can be attributed to the lack of 3D frequency constraints and the usage of a 2D dilation filter. To address this problem, we introduce a 3D smoothing filter which constrains the size of the 3D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency induced by the input views, eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Moreover, replacing 2D dilation with a 2D Mip filter, which simulates a 2D box filter, effectively mitigates aliasing and dilation issues. Our evaluation, including scenarios such a training on single-scale images and testing on multiple scales, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 2023-11-27 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://niujinshuchong.github.io/mip-splatting/</p></details> |
| **[LucidDreamer: Domain-free Generation of 3D Gaussian Splatting Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13384v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread usage of VR devices and contents, demands for 3D scene generation techniques become more popular. Existing 3D scene generation models, however, limit the target scene to specific domain, primarily due to their training strategies using 3D scan dataset that is far from the real-world. To address such limitation, we propose LucidDreamer, a domain-free scene generation pipeline by fully leveraging the power of existing large-scale diffusion-based generative model. Our LucidDreamer has two alternate steps: Dreaming and Alignment. First, to generate multi-view consistent images from inputs, we set the point cloud as a geometrical guideline for each image generation. Specifically, we project a portion of point cloud to the desired view and provide the projection as a guidance for inpainting using the generative model. The inpainted images are lifted to 3D space with estimated depth maps, composing a new points. Second, to aggregate the new points into the 3D scene, we propose an aligning algorithm which harmoniously integrates the portions of newly generated 3D scenes. The finally obtained 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. LucidDreamer produces Gaussian splats that are highly-detailed compared to the previous 3D scene generation methods, with no constraint on domain of the target scene.

| **[Deformable 3D Gaussians for High-Fidelity Monocular Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13101v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit neural representation has paved the way for new approaches to dynamic scene reconstruction and rendering. Nonetheless, cutting-edge dynamic neural rendering methods rely heavily on these implicit representations, which frequently struggle to capture the intricate details of objects in the scene. Furthermore, implicit methods have difficulty achieving real-time rendering in general dynamic scenes, limiting their use in a variety of tasks. To address the issues, we propose a deformable 3D Gaussians Splatting method that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussians and learns them in canonical space with a deformation field to model monocular dynamic scenes. We also introduce an annealing smoothing training mechanism with no extra overhead, which can mitigate the impact of inaccurate poses on the smoothness of time interpolation tasks in real-world datasets. Through a differential Gaussian rasterizer, the deformable 3D Gaussians not only achieve higher rendering quality but also real-time rendering speed. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of both rendering quality and speed, making it well-suited for tasks such as novel-view synthesis, time interpolation, and real-time rendering.</p></details> | 2023-11-19 |  |
| **[SplatArmor: Articulated Gaussian splatting for animatable humans from monocular RGB videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10812v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SplatArmor, a novel approach for recovering detailed and animatable human models by `armoring' a parameterized body model with 3D Gaussians. Our approach represents the human as a set of 3D Gaussians within a canonical space, whose articulation is defined by extending the skinning of the underlying SMPL geometry to arbitrary locations in the canonical space. To account for pose-dependent effects, we introduce a SE(3) field, which allows us to capture both the location and anisotropy of the Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose the use of a neural color field to provide color regularization and 3D supervision for the precise positioning of these Gaussians. We show that Gaussian splatting provides an interesting alternative to neural rendering based methods by leverging a rasterization primitive without facing any of the non-differentiability and optimization challenges typically faced in such approaches. The rasterization paradigms allows us to leverage forward skinning, and does not suffer from the ambiguities associated with inverse skinning and warping. We show compelling results on the ZJU MoCap and People Snapshot datasets, which underscore the effectiveness of our method for controllable human synthesis.</p></details> | 2023-11-17 |  |
| **[Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08581v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars (D3GA), the first 3D controllable model for human bodies rendered with Gaussian splats. Current photorealistic drivable avatars require either accurate 3D registrations during training, dense input images during testing, or both. The ones based on neural radiance fields also tend to be prohibitively slow for telepresence applications. This work uses the recently presented 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render realistic humans at real-time framerates, using dense calibrated multi-view videos as input. To deform those primitives, we depart from the commonly used point deformation method of linear blend skinning (LBS) and use a classic volumetric deformation method: cage deformations. Given their smaller size, we drive these deformations with joint angles and keypoints, which are more suitable for communication applications. Our experiments on nine subjects with varied body shapes, clothes, and motions obtain higher-quality results than state-of-the-art methods when using the same training and test data.</p></details> | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://zielon.github.io/d3ga/</p></details> |
