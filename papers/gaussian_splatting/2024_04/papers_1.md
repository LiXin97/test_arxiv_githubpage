| **[GS-LRM: Large Reconstruction Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19702v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GS-LRM, a scalable large reconstruction model that can predict high-quality 3D Gaussian primitives from 2-4 posed sparse images in 0.23 seconds on single A100 GPU. Our model features a very simple transformer-based architecture; we patchify input posed images, pass the concatenated multi-view image tokens through a sequence of transformer blocks, and decode final per-pixel Gaussian parameters directly from these tokens for differentiable rendering. In contrast to previous LRMs that can only reconstruct objects, by predicting per-pixel Gaussians, GS-LRM naturally handles scenes with large variations in scale and complexity. We show that our model can work on both object and scene captures by training it on Objaverse and RealEstate10K respectively. In both scenarios, the models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin. We also demonstrate applications of our model in downstream 3D generation tasks.

| **[SAGS: Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19149v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following the advent of NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has paved the way to real-time neural rendering overcoming the computational burden of volumetric methods. Following the pioneering work of 3D-GS, several methods have attempted to achieve compressible and high-fidelity performance alternatives. However, by employing a geometry-agnostic optimization scheme, these methods neglect the inherent 3D structure of the scene, thereby restricting the expressivity and the quality of the representation, resulting in various floating points and artifacts. In this work, we propose a structure-aware Gaussian Splatting method (SAGS) that implicitly encodes the geometry of the scene, which reflects to state-of-the-art rendering performance and reduced storage requirements on benchmark novel-view synthesis datasets. SAGS is founded on a local-global graph representation that facilitates the learning of complex scenes and enforces meaningful point displacements that preserve the scene's geometry. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight version of SAGS, using a simple yet effective mid-point interpolation scheme, which showcases a compact representation of the scene with up to 24$\times$ size reduction without the reliance on any compression strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SAGS compared to state-of-the-art 3D-GS methods under both rendering quality and model size. Besides, we demonstrate that our structure-aware method can effectively mitigate floating artifacts and irregular distortions of previous methods while obtaining precise depth maps.

| **[GSTalker: Real-time Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation via Deformable Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19040v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GStalker, a 3D audio-driven talking face generation model with Gaussian Splatting for both fast training (40 minutes) and real-time rendering (125 FPS) with a 3$\sim$5 minute video for training material, in comparison with previous 2D and 3D NeRF-based modeling frameworks which require hours of training and seconds of rendering per frame. Specifically, GSTalker learns an audio-driven Gaussian deformation field to translate and transform 3D Gaussians to synchronize with audio information, in which multi-resolution hashing grid-based tri-plane and temporal smooth module are incorporated to learn accurate deformation for fine-grained facial details. In addition, a pose-conditioned deformation field is designed to model the stabilized torso. To enable efficient optimization of the condition Gaussian deformation field, we initialize 3D Gaussians by learning a coarse static Gaussian representation. Extensive experiments in person-specific videos with audio tracks validate that GSTalker can generate high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized results with fast training and real-time rendering speed.</p></details> | 2024-04-29 |  |
| **[MeGA: Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar for High-Fidelity Rendering and Head Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19026v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating high-fidelity head avatars from multi-view videos is a core issue for many AR/VR applications. However, existing methods usually struggle to obtain high-quality renderings for all different head components simultaneously since they use one single representation to model components with drastically different characteristics (e.g., skin vs. hair). In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar (MeGA) that models different head components with more suitable representations. Specifically, we select an enhanced FLAME mesh as our facial representation and predict a UV displacement map to provide per-vertex offsets for improved personalized geometric details. To achieve photorealistic renderings, we obtain facial colors using deferred neural rendering and disentangle neural textures into three meaningful parts. For hair modeling, we first build a static canonical hair using 3D Gaussian Splatting. A rigid transformation and an MLP-based deformation field are further applied to handle complex dynamic expressions. Combined with our occlusion-aware blending, MeGA generates higher-fidelity renderings for the whole head and naturally supports more downstream tasks. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and supporting various editing functionalities, including hairstyle alteration and texture editing.</p></details> | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://conallwang.github.io/MeGA_Pages/</p></details> |
| **[SLAM for Indoor Mapping of Wide Area Construction Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17215v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), i.e., the reconstruction of the environment represented by a (3D) map and the concurrent pose estimation, has made astonishing progress. Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.</p></details> | 2024-04-26 |  |
| **[Interactive3D: Create What You Want by Interactive 3D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16510v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object generation has undergone significant advancements, yielding high-quality results. However, fall short of achieving precise user control, often yielding results that do not align with user expectations, thus limiting their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability, or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process, restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications. In this work, we introduce Interactive3D, an innovative framework for interactive 3D generation that grants users precise control over the generative process through extensive 3D interaction capabilities. Interactive3D is constructed in two cascading stages, utilizing distinct 3D representations. The first stage employs Gaussian Splatting for direct user interaction, allowing modifications and guidance of the generative direction at any intermediate step through (i) Adding and Removing components, (ii) Deformable and Rigid Dragging, (iii) Geometric Transformations, and (iv) Semantic Editing. Subsequently, the Gaussian splats are transformed into InstantNGP. We introduce a novel (v) Interactive Hash Refinement module to further add details and extract the geometry in the second stage. Our experiments demonstrate that Interactive3D markedly improves the controllability and quality of 3D generation.

| **[GaussianTalker: Real-Time High-Fidelity Talking Head Synthesis with Audio-Driven 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16012v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GaussianTalker, a novel framework for real-time generation of pose-controllable talking heads. It leverages the fast rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) while addressing the challenges of directly controlling 3DGS with speech audio. GaussianTalker constructs a canonical 3DGS representation of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. A key insight is to encode the 3D Gaussian attributes into a shared implicit feature representation, where it is merged with audio features to manipulate each Gaussian attribute. This design exploits the spatial-aware features and enforces interactions between neighboring points. The feature embeddings are then fed to a spatial-audio attention module, which predicts frame-wise offsets for the attributes of each Gaussian. It is more stable than previous concatenation or multiplication approaches for manipulating the numerous Gaussians and their intricate parameters. Experimental results showcase GaussianTalker's superiority in facial fidelity, lip synchronization accuracy, and rendering speed compared to previous methods. Specifically, GaussianTalker achieves a remarkable rendering speed up to 120 FPS, surpassing previous benchmarks.

| **[TIP-Editor: An Accurate 3D Editor Following Both Text-Prompts And Image-Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14828v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven 3D scene editing has gained significant attention owing to its convenience and user-friendliness. However, existing methods still lack accurate control of the specified appearance and location of the editing result due to the inherent limitations of the text description. To this end, we propose a 3D scene editing framework, TIPEditor, that accepts both text and image prompts and a 3D bounding box to specify the editing region. With the image prompt, users can conveniently specify the detailed appearance/style of the target content in complement to the text description, enabling accurate control of the appearance. Specifically, TIP-Editor employs a stepwise 2D personalization strategy to better learn the representation of the existing scene and the reference image, in which a localization loss is proposed to encourage correct object placement as specified by the bounding box. Additionally, TIPEditor utilizes explicit and flexible 3D Gaussian splatting as the 3D representation to facilitate local editing while keeping the background unchanged. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that TIP-Editor conducts accurate editing following the text and image prompts in the specified bounding box region, consistently outperforming the baselines in editing quality, and the alignment to the prompts, qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by Siggraph 2024 & ACM Transactions on Graphics</p></details> |
| **[Guess The Unseen: Dynamic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Partial 2D Glimpses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14410v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct the world and multiple dynamic humans in 3D from a monocular video input. As a key idea, we represent both the world and multiple humans via the recently emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) representation, enabling to conveniently and efficiently compose and render them together. In particular, we address the scenarios with severely limited and sparse observations in 3D human reconstruction, a common challenge encountered in the real world. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach to optimize the 3D-GS representation in a canonical space by fusing the sparse cues in the common space, where we leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to synthesize unseen views while keeping the consistency with the observed 2D appearances. We demonstrate our method can reconstruct high-quality animatable 3D humans in various challenging examples, in the presence of occlusion, image crops, few-shot, and extremely sparse observations. After reconstruction, our method is capable of not only rendering the scene in any novel views at arbitrary time instances, but also editing the 3D scene by removing individual humans or applying different motions for each human. Through various experiments, we demonstrate the quality and efficiency of our methods over alternative existing approaches.</p></details> | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at https://snuvclab.github.io/gtu/</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Gaussians Mesh: Consistent Mesh Reconstruction from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12379v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern 3D engines and graphics pipelines require mesh as a memory-efficient representation, which allows efficient rendering, geometry processing, texture editing, and many other downstream operations. However, it is still highly difficult to obtain high-quality mesh in terms of structure and detail from monocular visual observations. The problem becomes even more challenging for dynamic scenes and objects. To this end, we introduce Dynamic Gaussians Mesh (DG-Mesh), a framework to reconstruct a high-fidelity and time-consistent mesh given a single monocular video. Our work leverages the recent advancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct the mesh sequence with temporal consistency from a video. Building on top of this representation, DG-Mesh recovers high-quality meshes from the Gaussian points and can track the mesh vertices over time, which enables applications such as texture editing on dynamic objects. We introduce the Gaussian-Mesh Anchoring, which encourages evenly distributed Gaussians, resulting better mesh reconstruction through mesh-guided densification and pruning on the deformed Gaussians. By applying cycle-consistent deformation between the canonical and the deformed space, we can project the anchored Gaussian back to the canonical space and optimize Gaussians across all time frames. During the evaluation on different datasets, DG-Mesh provides significantly better mesh reconstruction and rendering than baselines.

| **[CoGS: Controllable Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05664v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing and re-animating the 3D structure of articulated objects present significant barriers. On one hand, methods requiring extensively calibrated multi-view setups are prohibitively complex and resource-intensive, limiting their practical applicability. On the other hand, while single-camera Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) offer a more streamlined approach, they have excessive training and rendering costs. 3D Gaussian Splatting would be a suitable alternative but for two reasons. Firstly, existing methods for 3D dynamic Gaussians require synchronized multi-view cameras, and secondly, the lack of controllability in dynamic scenarios. We present CoGS, a method for Controllable Gaussian Splatting, that enables the direct manipulation of scene elements, offering real-time control of dynamic scenes without the prerequisite of pre-computing control signals. We evaluated CoGS using both synthetic and real-world datasets that include dynamic objects that differ in degree of difficulty. In our evaluations, CoGS consistently outperformed existing dynamic and controllable neural representations in terms of visual fidelity.</p></details> | 2024-04-22 | CVPR 2024 |
| **[CLIP-GS: CLIP-Informed Gaussian Splatting for Real-time and View-consistent 3D Semantic Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14249v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) exhibits high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes. Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes. To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data. In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach. SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model. 3DCS imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method.</p></details> | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/gbliao/CLIP-GS</p></details> |
| **[EGGS: Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting for Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09105v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, their loss function only contains the $\ell_1$ norm and the structural similarity between the rendered and input images, without considering the edges in these images. It is well-known that the edges in an image provide important information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting (EGGS) method that leverages the edges in the input images. More specifically, we give the edge region a higher weight than the flat region. With such edge guidance, the resulting Gaussian particles focus more on the edges instead of the flat regions. Moreover, such edge guidance does not crease the computation cost during the training and rendering stage. The experiments confirm that such simple edge-weighted loss function indeed improves about $1\sim2$ dB on several difference data sets. With simply plugging in the edge guidance, the proposed method can improve all Gaussian splatting methods in different scenarios, such as human head modeling, building 3D reconstruction, etc.</p></details> | 2024-04-22 |  |
| **[GScream: Learning 3D Geometry and Feature Consistent Gaussian Splatting for Object Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13679v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles the intricate challenge of object removal to update the radiance field using the 3D Gaussian Splatting. The main challenges of this task lie in the preservation of geometric consistency and the maintenance of texture coherence in the presence of the substantial discrete nature of Gaussian primitives. We introduce a robust framework specifically designed to overcome these obstacles. The key insight of our approach is the enhancement of information exchange among visible and invisible areas, facilitating content restoration in terms of both geometry and texture. Our methodology begins with optimizing the positioning of Gaussian primitives to improve geometric consistency across both removed and visible areas, guided by an online registration process informed by monocular depth estimation. Following this, we employ a novel feature propagation mechanism to bolster texture coherence, leveraging a cross-attention design that bridges sampling Gaussians from both uncertain and certain areas. This innovative approach significantly refines the texture coherence within the final radiance field. Extensive experiments validate that our method not only elevates the quality of novel view synthesis for scenes undergoing object removal but also showcases notable efficiency gains in training and rendering speeds.</p></details> | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://w-ted.github.io/publications/gscream</p></details> |
| **[Learn2Talk: 3D Talking Face Learns from 2D Talking Face](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12888v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-driven facial animation methods usually contain two main classes, 3D and 2D talking face, both of which attract considerable research attention in recent years. However, to the best of our knowledge, the research on 3D talking face does not go deeper as 2D talking face, in the aspect of lip-synchronization (lip-sync) and speech perception. To mind the gap between the two sub-fields, we propose a learning framework named Learn2Talk, which can construct a better 3D talking face network by exploiting two expertise points from the field of 2D talking face. Firstly, inspired by the audio-video sync network, a 3D sync-lip expert model is devised for the pursuit of lip-sync between audio and 3D facial motion. Secondly, a teacher model selected from 2D talking face methods is used to guide the training of the audio-to-3D motions regression network to yield more 3D vertex accuracy. Extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of lip-sync, vertex accuracy and speech perception, compared with state-of-the-arts. Finally, we show two applications of the proposed framework: audio-visual speech recognition and speech-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting based avatar animation.</p></details> | 2024-04-19 |  |
| **[EfficientGS: Streamlining Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale High-Resolution Scene Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12777v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of 3D scene representation, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technology. However, its application to large-scale, high-resolution scenes (exceeding 4k$\times$4k pixels) is hindered by the excessive computational requirements for managing a large number of Gaussians. Addressing this, we introduce 'EfficientGS', an advanced approach that optimizes 3DGS for high-resolution, large-scale scenes. We analyze the densification process in 3DGS and identify areas of Gaussian over-proliferation. We propose a selective strategy, limiting Gaussian increase to key primitives, thereby enhancing the representational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a pruning mechanism to remove redundant Gaussians, those that are merely auxiliary to adjacent ones. For further enhancement, we integrate a sparse order increment for Spherical Harmonics (SH), designed to alleviate storage constraints and reduce training overhead. Our empirical evaluations, conducted on a range of datasets including extensive 4K+ aerial images, demonstrate that 'EfficientGS' not only expedites training and rendering times but also achieves this with a model size approximately tenfold smaller than conventional 3DGS while maintaining high rendering fidelity.</p></details> | 2024-04-19 |  |
| **[DeblurGS: Gaussian Splatting for Camera Motion Blur](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11358v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although significant progress has been made in reconstructing sharp 3D scenes from motion-blurred images, a transition to real-world applications remains challenging. The primary obstacle stems from the severe blur which leads to inaccuracies in the acquisition of initial camera poses through Structure-from-Motion, a critical aspect often overlooked by previous approaches. To address this challenge, we propose DeblurGS, a method to optimize sharp 3D Gaussian Splatting from motion-blurred images, even with the noisy camera pose initialization. We restore a fine-grained sharp scene by leveraging the remarkable reconstruction capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach estimates the 6-Degree-of-Freedom camera motion for each blurry observation and synthesizes corresponding blurry renderings for the optimization process. Furthermore, we propose Gaussian Densification Annealing strategy to prevent the generation of inaccurate Gaussians at erroneous locations during the early training stages when camera motion is still imprecise. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our DeblurGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in deblurring and novel view synthesis for real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets, as well as field-captured blurry smartphone videos.</p></details> | 2024-04-18 |  |
| **[RainyScape: Unsupervised Rainy Scene Reconstruction using Decoupled Neural Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11401v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose RainyScape, an unsupervised framework for reconstructing clean scenes from a collection of multi-view rainy images. RainyScape consists of two main modules: a neural rendering module and a rain-prediction module that incorporates a predictor network and a learnable latent embedding that captures the rain characteristics of the scene. Specifically, based on the spectral bias property of neural networks, we first optimize the neural rendering pipeline to obtain a low-frequency scene representation. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the two modules, driven by the proposed adaptive direction-sensitive gradient-based reconstruction loss, which encourages the network to distinguish between scene details and rain streaks, facilitating the propagation of gradients to the relevant components. Extensive experiments on both the classic neural radiance field and the recently proposed 3D Gaussian splatting demonstrate the superiority of our method in effectively eliminating rain streaks and rendering clean images, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The constructed high-quality dataset and source code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 2024-04-17 |  |
| **[Splatter Image: Ultra-Fast Single-View 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13150v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \method, an ultra-efficient approach for monocular 3D object reconstruction. Splatter Image is based on Gaussian Splatting, which allows fast and high-quality reconstruction of 3D scenes from multiple images. We apply Gaussian Splatting to monocular reconstruction by learning a neural network that, at test time, performs reconstruction in a feed-forward manner, at 38 FPS. Our main innovation is the surprisingly straightforward design of this network, which, using 2D operators, maps the input image to one 3D Gaussian per pixel. The resulting set of Gaussians thus has the form an image, the Splatter Image. We further extend the method take several images as input via cross-view attention. Owning to the speed of the renderer (588 FPS), we use a single GPU for training while generating entire images at each iteration to optimize perceptual metrics like LPIPS. On several synthetic, real, multi-category and large-scale benchmark datasets, we achieve better results in terms of PSNR, LPIPS, and other metrics while training and evaluating much faster than prior works.

| **[LoopGaussian: Creating 3D Cinemagraph with Multi-view Images via Eulerian Motion Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08966v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cinemagraph is a unique form of visual media that combines elements of still photography and subtle motion to create a captivating experience. However, the majority of videos generated by recent works lack depth information and are confined to the constraints of 2D image space. In this paper, inspired by significant progress in the field of novel view synthesis (NVS) achieved by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), we propose LoopGaussian to elevate cinemagraph from 2D image space to 3D space using 3D Gaussian modeling. To achieve this, we first employ the 3D-GS method to reconstruct 3D Gaussian point clouds from multi-view images of static scenes,incorporating shape regularization terms to prevent blurring or artifacts caused by object deformation. We then adopt an autoencoder tailored for 3D Gaussian to project it into feature space. To maintain the local continuity of the scene, we devise SuperGaussian for clustering based on the acquired features. By calculating the similarity between clusters and employing a two-stage estimation method, we derive an Eulerian motion field to describe velocities across the entire scene. The 3D Gaussian points then move within the estimated Eulerian motion field. Through bidirectional animation techniques, we ultimately generate a 3D Cinemagraph that exhibits natural and seamlessly loopable dynamics. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating high-quality and visually appealing scene generation.

To this end, we train our Gaussian parameter regression module on a large amount of human scan data, jointly with a depth estimation module to lift 2D parameter maps to 3D space.

| **[AbsGS: Recovering Fine Details for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10484v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) technique couples 3D Gaussian primitives with differentiable rasterization to achieve high-quality novel view synthesis results while providing advanced real-time rendering performance. However, due to the flaw of its adaptive density control strategy in 3D-GS, it frequently suffers from over-reconstruction issue in intricate scenes containing high-frequency details, leading to blurry rendered images. The underlying reason for the flaw has still been under-explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the cause of aforementioned artifacts, namely gradient collision, which prevents large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions from splitting. To address this issue, we propose the novel homodirectional view-space positional gradient as the criterion for densification. Our strategy efficiently identifies large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions, and recovers fine details by splitting. We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging datasets. The experimental results indicate that our approach achieves the best rendering quality with reduced or similar memory consumption. Our method is easy to implement and can be incorporated into a wide variety of most recent Gaussian Splatting-based methods. We will open source our codes upon formal publication.

| **[ASH: Animatable Gaussian Splats for Efficient and Photoreal Human Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05941v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time rendering of photorealistic and controllable human avatars stands as a cornerstone in Computer Vision and Graphics. While recent advances in neural implicit rendering have unlocked unprecedented photorealism for digital avatars, real-time performance has mostly been demonstrated for static scenes only. To address this, we propose ASH, an animatable Gaussian splatting approach for photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans in real-time. We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians, which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering. However, naively learning the Gaussian parameters in 3D space poses a severe challenge in terms of compute. Instead, we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model, and learn their parameters in 2D texture space, which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians. We benchmark ASH with competing methods on pose-controllable avatars, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing real-time methods by a large margin and shows comparable or even better results than offline methods.</p></details> | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>For p...</summary><p>For project page, see https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/ash/</p></details> |
| **[CompGS: Efficient 3D Scene Representation via Compressed Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09458v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian splatting, renowned for its exceptional rendering quality and efficiency, has emerged as a prominent technique in 3D scene representation. However, the substantial data volume of Gaussian splatting impedes its practical utility in real-world applications. Herein, we propose an efficient 3D scene representation, named Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS), which harnesses compact Gaussian primitives for faithful 3D scene modeling with a remarkably reduced data size. To ensure the compactness of Gaussian primitives, we devise a hybrid primitive structure that captures predictive relationships between each other. Then, we exploit a small set of anchor primitives for prediction, allowing the majority of primitives to be encapsulated into highly compact residual forms. Moreover, we develop a rate-constrained optimization scheme to eliminate redundancies within such hybrid primitives, steering our CompGS towards an optimal trade-off between bitrate consumption and representation efficacy. Experimental results show that the proposed CompGS significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compactness in 3D scene representation without compromising model accuracy and rendering quality. Our code will be released on GitHub for further research.</p></details> | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a conference</p></details> |

Most methods assume the people is in an unobstructed scene, while various objects may cause the occlusion of body parts in real-life scenarios. Previous method utilizing NeRF for surface rendering to recover the occluded areas, but it requiring more than one day to train and several seconds to render, failing to meet the requirements of real-time interactive applications. To address these issues, we propose OccGaussian based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which can be trained within 6 minutes and produces high-quality human renderings up to 160 FPS with occluded input. OccGaussian initializes 3D Gaussian distributions in the canonical space, and we perform occlusion feature query at occluded regions, the aggregated pixel-align feature is extracted to compensate for the missing information. Then we use Gaussian Feature MLP to further process the feature along with the occlusion-aware loss functions to better perceive the occluded area. Extensive experiments both in simulated and real-world occlusions, demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. And we improving training and inference speeds by 250x and 800x, respectively. Our code will be available for research purposes.</p></details> | 2024-04-15 |  |

Our method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Designed for challenging monocular settings, our approach is seamlessly extendable to RGB-D SLAM when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we introduce a full SLAM system which not only achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory estimation but also reconstruction of tiny and even transparent objects.</p></details> | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2024 Highlight.

| **[3D Geometry-aware Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06270v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a 3D geometry-aware deformable Gaussian Splatting method for dynamic view synthesis. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner, which cannot incorporate 3D scene geometry. Therefore, the learned deformation is not necessarily geometrically coherent, which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new representation of the 3D scene, building upon which the 3D geometry could be exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically, the scenes are represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian, where each 3D Gaussian is optimized to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene geometry constraint during deformation, we explicitly extract 3D geometry features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way, our solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling, which enables improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority of our solution, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Our expansive U-Scene dataset surpasses any previously existing real large-scale outdoor LiDAR and image dataset in both area and point count. GauU-Scene encompasses over 6.5 square kilometers and features a comprehensive RGB dataset coupled with LiDAR ground truth. Additionally, we are the first to propose a LiDAR and image alignment method for a drone-based dataset. Our assessment of GauU-Scene includes a detailed analysis across various novel viewpoints, employing image-based metrics such as SSIM, LPIPS, and PSNR on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting based methods. This analysis reveals contradictory results when applying geometric-based metrics like Chamfer distance. The experimental results on our multimodal dataset highlight the unreliability of current image-based metrics and reveal significant drawbacks in geometric reconstruction using the current Gaussian Splatting-based method, further illustrating the necessity of our dataset for assessing geometry reconstruction tasks.

Unlike neural implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that represent a 3D scene with position and viewpoint-conditioned neural networks, 3D Gaussian Splatting utilizes a set of Gaussian ellipsoids to model the scene so that efficient rendering can be accomplished by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids into images. Apart from the fast rendering speed, the explicit representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting facilitates editing tasks like dynamic reconstruction, geometry editing, and physical simulation. Considering the rapid change and growing number of works in this field, we present a literature review of recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, which can be roughly classified into 3D reconstruction, 3D editing, and other downstream applications by functionality. Traditional point-based rendering methods and the rendering formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting are also illustrated for a better understanding of this technique. This survey aims to help beginners get into this field quickly and provide experienced researchers with a comprehensive overview, which can stimulate the future development of the 3D Gaussian Splatting representation.</p></details> | 2024-04-13 |  |

However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur. In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data. Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS. The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background. Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations. By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss. Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs. It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously. We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS. The code and dataset will be made available for public access.</p></details> | 2024-04-12 |  |

Our technique optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts. We initialize these splats by utilizing the state-of-the-art text-to-image generators, lifting their samples into 3D, and computing the occlusion volume. We then optimize this representation across multiple views as a 3D inpainting task with image-conditional diffusion models. To learn correct geometric structure, we incorporate a depth diffusion model by conditioning on the samples from the inpainting model, giving rich geometric structure. Finally, we finetune the model using sharpened samples from image generators. Notably, our technique does not require video or multi-view data and can synthesize a variety of high-quality 3D scenes in different styles, consisting of multiple objects. Its generality additionally allows 3D synthesis from a single image.</p></details> | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://realmdreamer.github.io/</p></details> |

State-of-the-art algorithms are able to detect defects in increasingly difficult settings and data modalities. However, most current methods are not suited to address 3D objects captured from differing poses. While solutions using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been proposed, they suffer from excessive computation requirements, which hinder real-world usability. For this reason, we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which, given multi-view images of a 3D object, accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner, and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed, and detection performance, even when using less training data than competing methods. We thoroughly evaluate our framework using the recently proposed Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark and its multi-pose anomaly detection (MAD) data set.</p></details> | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Visua...</summary><p>Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection 2.0 Workshop at CVPR 2024</p></details> |

ADC has been introduced for automatic 3D point primitive management, controlling densification and pruning, however, with certain limitations in the densification logic. Our main contribution is a more principled, pixel-error driven formulation for density control in 3DGS, leveraging an auxiliary, per-pixel error function as the criterion for densification. We further introduce a mechanism to control the total number of primitives generated per scene and correct a bias in the current opacity handling strategy of ADC during cloning operations. Our approach leads to consistent quality improvements across a variety of benchmark scenes, without sacrificing the method's efficiency.</p></details> | 2024-04-09 |  |
| **[Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06091v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of 3D generative modeling has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model's inference in 3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments covering 5 text-to-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D's versatility to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 to 4 times. Additionally, Hash3D's integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly 30 seconds.

However, it often suffers from over-reconstruction during Gaussian densification where high-variance image regions are covered by a few large Gaussians only, leading to blur and artifacts in the rendered images. We design a progressive frequency regularization (FreGS) technique to tackle the over-reconstruction issue within the frequency space. Specifically, FreGS performs coarse-to-fine Gaussian densification by exploiting low-to-high frequency components that can be easily extracted with low-pass and high-pass filters in the Fourier space. By minimizing the discrepancy between the frequency spectrum of the rendered image and the corresponding ground truth, it achieves high-quality Gaussian densification and alleviates the over-reconstruction of Gaussian splatting effectively. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks (e.g., Mip-NeRF360, Tanks-and-Temples and Deep Blending) show that FreGS achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently.</p></details> | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024.

| **[Feature 3DGS: Supercharging 3D Gaussian Splatting to Enable Distilled Feature Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03203v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene representations have gained immense popularity in recent years. Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and (b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework encounters significant challenges, notably the disparities in spatial resolution and channel consistency between RGB images and feature maps. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to provide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both train and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first method to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field manipulation, by leveraging the SAM model.

It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussians in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets.

More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting emerged as a much faster alternative with superior rendering quality and training efficiency, especially for small-scale and object-centric scenarios. Nevertheless, this technique suffers from poor performance on unstructured in-the-wild data. To tackle this, we extend over 3D Gaussian Splatting to handle unstructured image collections. We achieve this by modeling appearance to seize photometric variations in the rendered images. Additionally, we introduce a new mechanism to train transient Gaussians to handle the presence of scene occluders in an unsupervised manner.

Existing methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality novel-view/novel-pose image synthesis but often require days of training, and are extremely slow at inference time. Recently, the community has explored fast grid structures for efficient training of clothed avatars. Albeit being extremely fast at training, these methods can barely achieve an interactive rendering frame rate with around 15 FPS. In this paper, we use 3D Gaussian Splatting and learn a non-rigid deformation network to reconstruct animatable clothed human avatars that can be trained within 30 minutes and rendered at real-time frame rates (50+ FPS). Given the explicit nature of our representation, we further introduce as-isometric-as-possible regularizations on both the Gaussian mean vectors and the covariance matrices, enhancing the generalization of our model on highly articulated unseen poses. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable and even better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on animatable avatar creation from a monocular input, while being 400x and 250x faster in training and inference, respectively.</p></details> | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://neuralbodies.github.io/3DGS-Avatar</p></details> |

We adapt the Gaussian Splatting framework to enable novel view synthesis in CT based on limited sets of 2D image projections and without the need for Structure from Motion (SfM) methodologies. Therefore, we reduce the total scanning duration and the amount of radiation dose the patient receives during the scan. We adapted the loss function to our use-case by encouraging a stronger background and foreground distinction using two sparsity promoting regularizers: a beta loss and a total variation (TV) loss. Finally, we initialize the Gaussian locations across the 3D space using a uniform prior distribution of where the brain's positioning would be expected to be within the field of view. We evaluate the performance of our model using brain CT scans from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset and demonstrate that the rendered novel views closely match the original projection views of the simulated scan, and have better performance than other implicit 3D scene representations methodologies. Furthermore, we empirically observe reduced training time compared to neural network based image synthesis for sparse-view CT image reconstruction. Finally, the memory requirements of the Gaussian Splatting representations are reduced by 17% compared to the equivalent voxel grid image representations.</p></details> | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review Process for MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Instead of leveraging matching-based solutions from 2D wireframes (or line segments) for 3D wireframe reconstruction as done in prior arts, we present NEAT, a rendering-distilling formulation using neural fields to represent 3D line segments with 2D observations, and bipartite matching for perceiving and distilling of a sparse set of 3D global junctions. The proposed {NEAT} enjoys the joint optimization of the neural fields and the global junctions from scratch, using view-dependent 2D observations without precomputed cross-view feature matching. Comprehensive experiments on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate our NEAT's superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives for 3D wireframe reconstruction. Moreover, the distilled 3D global junctions by NEAT, are a better initialization than SfM points, for the recently-emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity novel view synthesis using about 20 times fewer initial 3D points.

| **[Analytic-Splatting: Anti-Aliased 3D Gaussian Splatting via Analytic Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11056v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gained its popularity recently by combining the advantages of both primitive-based and volumetric 3D representations, resulting in improved quality and efficiency for 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS is not alias-free, and its rendering at varying resolutions could produce severe blurring or jaggies. This is because 3DGS treats each pixel as an isolated, single point rather than as an area, causing insensitivity to changes in the footprints of pixels. Consequently, this discrete sampling scheme inevitably results in aliasing, owing to the restricted sampling bandwidth. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution to address this issue. More specifically, we use a conditioned logistic function as the analytic approximation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a one-dimensional Gaussian signal and calculate the Gaussian integral by subtracting the CDFs. We then introduce this approximation in the two-dimensional pixel shading, and present Analytic-Splatting, which analytically approximates the Gaussian integral within the 2D-pixel window area to better capture the intensity response of each pixel. Moreover, we use the approximated response of the pixel window integral area to participate in the transmittance calculation of volume rendering, making Analytic-Splatting sensitive to the changes in pixel footprint at different resolutions. Experiments on various datasets validate that our approach has better anti-aliasing capability that gives more details and better fidelity.</p></details> | 2024-04-03 | 29 pages |

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods have recently risen to prominence for their exceptional ability to reconstruct scenes but are hampered by slow inference speed, prolonged training, and inconsistent depth estimation. Some previous work utilizes ground truth depth for optimization but is hard to acquire in the surgical domain. To overcome these obstacles, we present Endo-4DGS, a real-time endoscopic dynamic reconstruction approach that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for 3D representation. Specifically, we propose lightweight MLPs to capture temporal dynamics with Gaussian deformation fields. To obtain a satisfactory Gaussian Initialization, we exploit a powerful depth estimation foundation model, Depth-Anything, to generate pseudo-depth maps as a geometry prior. We additionally propose confidence-guided learning to tackle the ill-pose problems in monocular depth estimation and enhance the depth-guided reconstruction with surface normal constraints and depth regularization. Our approach has been validated on two surgical datasets, where it can effectively render in real-time, compute efficiently, and reconstruct with remarkable accuracy.</p></details> | 2024-04-02 |  |
| **[Text-to-3D using Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16585v4)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic text-to-3D generation that combines Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with the optimization of volume rendering has achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing realistic 3D objects. Yet most existing text-to-3D methods by SDS and volume rendering suffer from inaccurate geometry, e.g., the Janus issue, since it is hard to explicitly integrate 3D priors into implicit 3D representations. Besides, it is usually time-consuming for them to generate elaborate 3D models with rich colors. In response, this paper proposes GSGEN, a novel method that adopts Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to text-to-3D generation. GSGEN aims at generating high-quality 3D objects and addressing existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature of Gaussian Splatting that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under 3D point cloud diffusion prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS optimization, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative appearance refinement to enrich texture details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D assets with delicate details and accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components.

| **[MM3DGS SLAM: Multi-modal 3D Gaussian Splatting for SLAM Using Vision, Depth, and Inertial Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00923v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping is essential for position tracking and scene understanding. 3D Gaussian-based map representations enable photorealistic reconstruction and real-time rendering of scenes using multiple posed cameras. We show for the first time that using 3D Gaussians for map representation with unposed camera images and inertial measurements can enable accurate SLAM. Our method, MM3DGS, addresses the limitations of prior neural radiance field-based representations by enabling faster rendering, scale awareness, and improved trajectory tracking. Our framework enables keyframe-based mapping and tracking utilizing loss functions that incorporate relative pose transformations from pre-integrated inertial measurements, depth estimates, and measures of photometric rendering quality. We also release a multi-modal dataset, UT-MM, collected from a mobile robot equipped with a camera and an inertial measurement unit. Experimental evaluation on several scenes from the dataset shows that MM3DGS achieves 3x improvement in tracking and 5% improvement in photometric rendering quality compared to the current 3DGS SLAM state-of-the-art, while allowing real-time rendering of a high-resolution dense 3D map.
