| **[The Essential Role of Causality in Foundation World Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06665v2)**<details>Recent advances in foundation models, especially in large multi-modal models and conversational agents, have ignited interest in the potential of generally capable embodied agents. Such agents will require the ability to perform new tasks in many different real-world environments. However, current foundation models fail to accurately model physical interactions and are therefore insufficient for Embodied AI. The study of causality lends itself to the construction of veridical world models, which are crucial for accurately predicting the outcomes of possible interactions. This paper focuses on the prospects of building foundation world models for the upcoming generation of embodied agents and presents a novel viewpoint on the significance of causality within these. We posit that integrating causal considerations is vital to facilitating meaningful physical interactions with the world. Finally, we demystify misconceptions about causality in this context and present our outlook for future research.</details> | 2024-04-29 |  |
| **[Grounding Language Plans in Demonstrations Through Counterfactual Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17124v2)**<details>Grounding the common-sense reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) in physical domains remains a pivotal yet unsolved problem for embodied AI. Whereas prior works have focused on leveraging LLMs directly for planning in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the search of task structures and constraints implicit in multi-step demonstrations. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, which group robot configurations by specific motion constraints, to serve as an abstraction layer between the high-level language representations of an LLM and the low-level physical trajectories of a robot. By replaying a few human demonstrations with synthetic perturbations, we generate coverage over the demonstrations' state space with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains an end-to-end differentiable neural network to predict successful trajectories from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states and images in mode families without dense labeling. The learned grounding classifiers can further be used to translate language plans into reactive policies in the physical domain in an interpretable manner. We show our approach improves the interpretability and reactivity of imitation learning through 2D navigation and simulated and real robot manipulation tasks.

| **[Holodeck: Language Guided Generation of 3D Embodied AI Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09067v2)**<details>3D simulated environments play a critical role in Embodied AI, but their creation requires expertise and extensive manual effort, restricting their diversity and scope. To mitigate this limitation, we present Holodeck, a system that generates 3D environments to match a user-supplied prompt fully automatedly. Holodeck can generate diverse scenes, e.g., arcades, spas, and museums, adjust the designs for styles, and can capture the semantics of complex queries such as "apartment for a researcher with a cat" and "office of a professor who is a fan of Star Wars". Holodeck leverages a large language model (i.e., GPT-4) for common sense knowledge about what the scene might look like and uses a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse to populate the scene with diverse objects. To address the challenge of positioning objects correctly, we prompt GPT-4 to generate spatial relational constraints between objects and then optimize the layout to satisfy those constraints. Our large-scale human evaluation shows that annotators prefer Holodeck over manually designed procedural baselines in residential scenes and that Holodeck can produce high-quality outputs for diverse scene types. We also demonstrate an exciting application of Holodeck in Embodied AI, training agents to navigate in novel scenes like music rooms and daycares without human-constructed data, which is a significant step forward in developing general-purpose embodied agents.</details> | 2024-04-22 | <details>Published in CVPR 2024, 21 pages, 27 figures, 2 tables</details> |
| **[Large Language Models as Generalizable Policies for Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17722v2)**<details>We show that large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to be generalizable policies for embodied visual tasks. Our approach, called Large LAnguage model Reinforcement Learning Policy (LLaRP), adapts a pre-trained frozen LLM to take as input text instructions and visual egocentric observations and output actions directly in the environment. Using reinforcement learning, we train LLaRP to see and act solely through environmental interactions. We show that LLaRP is robust to complex paraphrasings of task instructions and can generalize to new tasks that require novel optimal behavior. In particular, on 1,000 unseen tasks it achieves 42% success rate, 1.7x the success rate of other common learned baselines or zero-shot applications of LLMs. Finally, to aid the community in studying language conditioned, massively multi-task, embodied AI problems we release a novel benchmark, Language Rearrangement, consisting of 150,000 training and 1,000 testing tasks for language-conditioned rearrangement. Video examples of LLaRP in unseen Language Rearrangement instructions are at https://llm-rl.github.io.</details> | 2024-04-16 |  |
| **[Efficient and accurate neural field reconstruction using resistive memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09613v1)**<details>Human beings construct perception of space by integrating sparse observations into massively interconnected synapses and neurons, offering a superior parallelism and efficiency. Replicating this capability in AI finds wide applications in medical imaging, AR/VR, and embodied AI, where input data is often sparse and computing resources are limited. However, traditional signal reconstruction methods on digital computers face both software and hardware challenges. On the software front, difficulties arise from storage inefficiencies in conventional explicit signal representation. Hardware obstacles include the von Neumann bottleneck, which limits data transfer between the CPU and memory, and the limitations of CMOS circuits in supporting parallel processing. We propose a systematic approach with software-hardware co-optimizations for signal reconstruction from sparse inputs. Software-wise, we employ neural field to implicitly represent signals via neural networks, which is further compressed using low-rank decomposition and structured pruning. Hardware-wise, we design a resistive memory-based computing-in-memory (CIM) platform, featuring a Gaussian Encoder (GE) and an MLP Processing Engine (PE). The GE harnesses the intrinsic stochasticity of resistive memory for efficient input encoding, while the PE achieves precise weight mapping through a Hardware-Aware Quantization (HAQ) circuit. We demonstrate the system's efficacy on a 40nm 256Kb resistive memory-based in-memory computing macro, achieving huge energy efficiency and parallelism improvements without compromising reconstruction quality in tasks like 3D CT sparse reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes. This work advances the AI-driven signal restoration technology and paves the way for future efficient and robust medical AI and 3D vision applications.</details> | 2024-04-15 |  |
| **[GOAT-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06609v1)**<details>The Embodied AI community has made significant strides in visual navigation tasks, exploring targets from 3D coordinates, objects, language descriptions, and images. However, these navigation models often handle only a single input modality as the target. With the progress achieved so far, it is time to move towards universal navigation models capable of handling various goal types, enabling more effective user interaction with robots. To facilitate this goal, we propose GOAT-Bench, a benchmark for the universal navigation task referred to as GO to AnyThing (GOAT). In this task, the agent is directed to navigate to a sequence of targets specified by the category name, language description, or image in an open-vocabulary fashion. We benchmark monolithic RL and modular methods on the GOAT task, analyzing their performance across modalities, the role of explicit and implicit scene memories, their robustness to noise in goal specifications, and the impact of memory in lifelong scenarios.</details> | 2024-04-09 |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Developmental AIs: From Simple Competences to Intelligent Human-Compatible AIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04586v21)**<details>Developmental AI creates embodied AIs that develop human-like abilities. The AIs start with innate competences and learn more by interacting with the world including people. Developmental AIs have been demonstrated, but their abilities so far do not surpass those of pre-toddler children. In contrast, mainstream approaches have led to impressive feats and commercially valuable AI systems. The approaches include deep learning and generative AI (e.g., large language models) and manually constructed symbolic modeling. However, manually constructed AIs tend to be brittle even in circumscribed domains. Generative AIs are helpful on average, but they can make strange mistakes and not notice them. Not learning from their experience in the world, they can lack common sense and social alignment. This position paper lays out prospects, gaps, and challenges for a bootstrapping approach to developmental AI that follows a bio-inspired trajectory. The approach creates experiential foundation models for human-compatible AIs. A virtuous multidisciplinary research cycle has led to developmental AIs with capabilities for multimodal perception, object recognition, and manipulation. Computational models for hierarchical planning, abstraction discovery, curiosity, and language acquisition exist but need to be adapted to an embodied learning approach. The remaining gaps include nonverbal communication, speech, reading, and writing. These competences enable people to acquire socially developed competences. Aspirationally, developmental AIs would learn, share what they learn, and collaborate to achieve high standards. They would learn to communicate, establish common ground, read critically, consider the provenance of information, test hypotheses, and collaborate. The approach would make the training of AIs more democratic.</details> | 2024-04-04 | <details>112 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables</details> |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v1)**<details>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</details> | 2024-04-02 |  |
