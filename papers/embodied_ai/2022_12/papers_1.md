| **[Objaverse: A Universe of Annotated 3D Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08051v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive data corpora like WebText, Wikipedia, Conceptual Captions, WebImageText, and LAION have propelled recent dramatic progress in AI. Large neural models trained on such datasets produce impressive results and top many of today's benchmarks. A notable omission within this family of large-scale datasets is 3D data. Despite considerable interest and potential applications in 3D vision, datasets of high-fidelity 3D models continue to be mid-sized with limited diversity of object categories. Addressing this gap, we present Objaverse 1.0, a large dataset of objects with 800K+ (and growing) 3D models with descriptive captions, tags, and animations. Objaverse improves upon present day 3D repositories in terms of scale, number of categories, and in the visual diversity of instances within a category. We demonstrate the large potential of Objaverse via four diverse applications: training generative 3D models, improving tail category segmentation on the LVIS benchmark, training open-vocabulary object-navigation models for Embodied AI, and creating a new benchmark for robustness analysis of vision models. Objaverse can open new directions for research and enable new applications across the field of AI.</p></details> | 2022-12-15 | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: objaverse.allenai.org</p></details> |
| **[Phone2Proc: Bringing Robust Robots Into Our Chaotic World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04819v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training embodied agents in simulation has become mainstream for the embodied AI community. However, these agents often struggle when deployed in the physical world due to their inability to generalize to real-world environments. In this paper, we present Phone2Proc, a method that uses a 10-minute phone scan and conditional procedural generation to create a distribution of training scenes that are semantically similar to the target environment. The generated scenes are conditioned on the wall layout and arrangement of large objects from the scan, while also sampling lighting, clutter, surface textures, and instances of smaller objects with randomized placement and materials. Leveraging just a simple RGB camera, training with Phone2Proc shows massive improvements from 34.7% to 70.7% success rate in sim-to-real ObjectNav performance across a test suite of over 200 trials in diverse real-world environments, including homes, offices, and RoboTHOR. Furthermore, Phone2Proc's diverse distribution of generated scenes makes agents remarkably robust to changes in the real world, such as human movement, object rearrangement, lighting changes, or clutter.</p></details> | 2022-12-08 | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://allenai.org/project/phone2proc</p></details> |
| **[Retrospectives on the Embodied AI Workshop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06849v3)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a retrospective on the state of Embodied AI research. Our analysis focuses on 13 challenges presented at the Embodied AI Workshop at CVPR. These challenges are grouped into three themes: (1) visual navigation, (2) rearrangement, and (3) embodied vision-and-language. We discuss the dominant datasets within each theme, evaluation metrics for the challenges, and the performance of state-of-the-art models. We highlight commonalities between top approaches to the challenges and identify potential future directions for Embodied AI research.</p></details> | 2022-12-05 |  |
| **[A General Purpose Supervisory Signal for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01186v1)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training effective embodied AI agents often involves manual reward engineering, expert imitation, specialized components such as maps, or leveraging additional sensors for depth and localization. Another approach is to use neural architectures alongside self-supervised objectives which encourage better representation learning. In practice, there are few guarantees that these self-supervised objectives encode task-relevant information. We propose the Scene Graph Contrastive (SGC) loss, which uses scene graphs as general-purpose, training-only, supervisory signals. The SGC loss does away with explicit graph decoding and instead uses contrastive learning to align an agent's representation with a rich graphical encoding of its environment. The SGC loss is generally applicable, simple to implement, and encourages representations that encode objects' semantics, relationships, and history. Using the SGC loss, we attain significant gains on three embodied tasks: Object Navigation, Multi-Object Navigation, and Arm Point Navigation. Finally, we present studies and analyses which demonstrate the ability of our trained representation to encode semantic cues about the environment.</p></details> | 2022-12-01 |  |
| **[Simple and Effective Synthesis of Indoor 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02960v2)** | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of synthesizing immersive 3D indoor scenes from one or more images. Our aim is to generate high-resolution images and videos from novel viewpoints, including viewpoints that extrapolate far beyond the input images while maintaining 3D consistency. Existing approaches are highly complex, with many separately trained stages and components. We propose a simple alternative: an image-to-image GAN that maps directly from reprojections of incomplete point clouds to full high-resolution RGB-D images. On the Matterport3D and RealEstate10K datasets, our approach significantly outperforms prior work when evaluated by humans, as well as on FID scores. Further, we show that our model is useful for generative data augmentation. A vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agent trained with trajectories spatially-perturbed by our model improves success rate by up to 1.5% over a state of the art baseline on the R2R benchmark. Our code will be made available to facilitate generative data augmentation and applications to downstream robotics and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | 2022-12-01 | AAAI 2023 |
