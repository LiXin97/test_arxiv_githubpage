| **[DASH: Modularized Human Manipulation Simulation with Vision and Language for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12536v1)**<details>Creating virtual humans with embodied, human-like perceptual and actuation constraints has the promise to provide an integrated simulation platform for many scientific and engineering applications. We present Dynamic and Autonomous Simulated Human (DASH), an embodied virtual human that, given natural language commands, performs grasp-and-stack tasks in a physically-simulated cluttered environment solely using its own visual perception, proprioception, and touch, without requiring human motion data. By factoring the DASH system into a vision module, a language module, and manipulation modules of two skill categories, we can mix and match analytical and machine learning techniques for different modules so that DASH is able to not only perform randomly arranged tasks with a high success rate, but also do so under anthropomorphic constraints and with fluid and diverse motions. The modular design also favors analysis and extensibility to more complex manipulation skills.</details> | 2021-08-28 | <details>SCA'2021</details> |
| **[The Surprising Effectiveness of Visual Odometry Techniques for Embodied PointGoal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11550v1)**<details>It is fundamental for personal robots to reliably navigate to a specified goal. To study this task, PointGoal navigation has been introduced in simulated Embodied AI environments. Recent advances solve this PointGoal navigation task with near-perfect accuracy (99.6% success) in photo-realistically simulated environments, assuming noiseless egocentric vision, noiseless actuation, and most importantly, perfect localization. However, under realistic noise models for visual sensors and actuation, and without access to a "GPS and Compass sensor," the 99.6%-success agents for PointGoal navigation only succeed with 0.3%. In this work, we demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of visual odometry for the task of PointGoal navigation in this realistic setting, i.e., with realistic noise models for perception and actuation and without access to GPS and Compass sensors. We show that integrating visual odometry techniques into navigation policies improves the state-of-the-art on the popular Habitat PointNav benchmark by a large margin, improving success from 64.5% to 71.7% while executing 6.4 times faster.</details> | 2021-08-26 | <details>ICCV 2021</details> |
| **[Embodied AI-Driven Operation of Smart Cities: A Concise Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09823v1)**<details>A smart city can be seen as a framework, comprised of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). An intelligent network of connected devices that collect data with their sensors and transmit them using cloud technologies in order to communicate with other assets in the ecosystem plays a pivotal role in this framework. Maximizing the quality of life of citizens, making better use of resources, cutting costs, and improving sustainability are the ultimate goals that a smart city is after. Hence, data collected from connected devices will continuously get thoroughly analyzed to gain better insights into the services that are being offered across the city; with this goal in mind that they can be used to make the whole system more efficient. Robots and physical machines are inseparable parts of a smart city. Embodied AI is the field of study that takes a deeper look into these and explores how they can fit into real-world environments. It focuses on learning through interaction with the surrounding environment, as opposed to Internet AI which tries to learn from static datasets. Embodied AI aims to train an agent that can See (Computer Vision), Talk (NLP), Navigate and Interact with its environment (Reinforcement Learning), and Reason (General Intelligence), all at the same time. Autonomous driving cars and personal companions are some of the examples that benefit from Embodied AI nowadays. In this paper, we attempt to do a concise review of this field. We will go through its definitions, its characteristics, and its current achievements along with different algorithms, approaches, and solutions that are being used in different components of it (e.g. Vision, NLP, RL). We will then explore all the available simulators and 3D interactable databases that will make the research in this area feasible. Finally, we will address its challenges and identify its potentials for future research.</details> | 2021-08-22 | <details>Cyberphysical Smart Cities Infrastructures: Optimal Operation and Intelligent Decision Making 2021</details> |
| **[SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in 3D Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06180v1)**<details>Recent advancements in deep learning, computer vision, and embodied AI have given rise to synthetic causal reasoning video datasets. These datasets facilitate the development of AI algorithms that can reason about physical interactions between objects. However, datasets thus far have primarily focused on elementary physical events such as rolling or falling. There is currently a scarcity of datasets that focus on the physical interactions that humans perform daily with objects in the real world. To address this scarcity, we introduce SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in 3D Environments. The SPACE simulator allows us to generate the SPACE dataset, a synthetic video dataset in a 3D environment, to systematically evaluate physics-based models on a range of physical causal reasoning tasks. Inspired by daily object interactions, the SPACE dataset comprises videos depicting three types of physical events: containment, stability and contact. These events make up the vast majority of the basic physical interactions between objects. We then further evaluate it with a state-of-the-art physics-based deep model and show that the SPACE dataset improves the learning of intuitive physics with an approach inspired by curriculum learning.

| **[BEHAVIOR: Benchmark for Everyday Household Activities in Virtual, Interactive, and Ecological Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03332v1)**<details>We introduce BEHAVIOR, a benchmark for embodied AI with 100 activities in simulation, spanning a range of everyday household chores such as cleaning, maintenance, and food preparation. These activities are designed to be realistic, diverse, and complex, aiming to reproduce the challenges that agents must face in the real world. Building such a benchmark poses three fundamental difficulties for each activity: definition (it can differ by time, place, or person), instantiation in a simulator, and evaluation. BEHAVIOR addresses these with three innovations. First, we propose an object-centric, predicate logic-based description language for expressing an activity's initial and goal conditions, enabling generation of diverse instances for any activity. Second, we identify the simulator-agnostic features required by an underlying environment to support BEHAVIOR, and demonstrate its realization in one such simulator. Third, we introduce a set of metrics to measure task progress and efficiency, absolute and relative to human demonstrators. We include 500 human demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) to serve as the human ground truth. Our experiments demonstrate that even state of the art embodied AI solutions struggle with the level of realism, diversity, and complexity imposed by the activities in our benchmark. We make BEHAVIOR publicly available at behavior.stanford.edu to facilitate and calibrate the development of new embodied AI solutions.</details> | 2021-08-06 |  |
