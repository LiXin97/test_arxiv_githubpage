| **[DialFRED: Dialogue-Enabled Agents for Embodied Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13330v2)**<details>Language-guided Embodied AI benchmarks requiring an agent to navigate an environment and manipulate objects typically allow one-way communication: the human user gives a natural language command to the agent, and the agent can only follow the command passively. We present DialFRED, a dialogue-enabled embodied instruction following benchmark based on the ALFRED benchmark. DialFRED allows an agent to actively ask questions to the human user; the additional information in the user's response is used by the agent to better complete its task. We release a human-annotated dataset with 53K task-relevant questions and answers and an oracle to answer questions. To solve DialFRED, we propose a questioner-performer framework wherein the questioner is pre-trained with the human-annotated data and fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. We make DialFRED publicly available and encourage researchers to propose and evaluate their solutions to building dialog-enabled embodied agents.</details> | 2022-08-15 | <details>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted by RA-L</details> |
| **[Towards a Grounded Theory of Causation for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13973v2)**<details>There exist well-developed frameworks for causal modelling, but these require rather a lot of human domain expertise to define causal variables and perform interventions. In order to enable autonomous agents to learn abstract causal models through interactive experience, the existing theoretical foundations need to be extended and clarified. Existing frameworks give no guidance regarding variable choice / representation, and more importantly, give no indication as to which behaviour policies or physical transformations of state space shall count as interventions. The framework sketched in this paper describes actions as transformations of state space, for instance induced by an agent running a policy. This makes it possible to describe in a uniform way both transformations of the micro-state space and abstract models thereof, and say when the latter is veridical / grounded / natural. We then introduce (causal) variables, define a mechanism as an invariant predictor, and say when an action can be viewed as a ``surgical intervention'', thus bringing the objective of causal representation \& intervention skill learning into clearer focus.</details> | 2022-08-12 |  |
